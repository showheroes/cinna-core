/**
 * Shared vocabulary for the Auto Routing Tuning card.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything in this file:
 *
 * 1. **No diagnosis prose lives here.** `diagnosis.verdict`, `diagnosis.action`,
 *    `message_text_notice`, `near_miss_notice`, `diff.summary` and the
 *    recommendation `notice` are computed and tested on the backend
 *    (plan §9/§10) and are rendered verbatim by the components. What this file
 *    holds is *labels* for machine codes and chrome copy for controls — the
 *    same split `ChannelDebugDialog`'s `KIND_META` already makes.
 * 2. **An unknown code must still render.** Every lookup below falls through to
 *    the raw value rather than to a blank. The `origin` and `outcome`
 *    vocabularies grow on the backend without a migration (see the route
 *    docstrings), and `origin="simulate"` is itself brand new — a card that
 *    blanks on a value it has not met fails exactly when something new is
 *    happening.
