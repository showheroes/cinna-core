/**
 * Runtime narrowing for `RoutingDecisionPublic.stages`.
 *
 * **Why this file exists at all.** Everything else on this card uses the
 * generated types from `@/client` directly. `stages` is the one field the
 * generator cannot type: the backend column is JSONB, so the OpenAPI schema
 * says `Array<unknown>` and nothing more. These interfaces are therefore a
 * *narrowing of an untyped payload*, not a hand-written copy of a type the
 * generator already emits.
 *
 * **Every field is optional, and that is deliberate.** Two independent reasons:
 *
 * - `SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS` (`routing_trace.py`) is an allowlist. With
 *   `ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT` off, `prompt`, `raw_response` and
 *   `llm_attempts[].error` are simply *absent* from the payload rather than
 *   null. `message_text_notice` explains that to the reader; the components
 *   render the notice, never a guess.
 * - These rows are written by a recorder whose dataclasses keep changing, and
 *   a row written by an older build must still render. The backend's own
 *   `stages` readers are defensive throughout for the same reason.
 *
 * So parsing here never throws and never asserts: an unreadable stage is
 * dropped, an unreadable field comes back `undefined`, and the components
 * treat "absent" as something to say out loud rather than something to fill in.
