 * its latest call, so a `variables?.id === row.id` gate unfreezes an in-flight
 * row the moment a second row is clicked (memory:
 * `project_shared_mutation_row_pending`); one observer per row cannot get that
 * wrong.
 *
 * All three settle through `invalidateAddons`, which is the only place that
 * knows the projection is a join and therefore which caches a plugin write
 * makes stale. A partial sync failure is handed up rather than toasted: an
 * install that reached three environments and failed on the fourth is not a
 * success with a footnote.
 *
 * Extracted from `AddonRow` because it is the half a second host would copy —
 * it holds no JSX and no row state.
