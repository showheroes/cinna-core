/**
 * One addon — a plugin or a skill, never both — as the plain P3 house row.
 *
 * Grown from `InstalledPluginRow` (whose mutations and confirm it carries
 * over) and `SkillRow` (whose status dot and detail facts it absorbs), so the
 * two lists the agent page used to show became one without either half losing
 * an affordance. The per-mode toggle the plugin row had is **not** on this row:
 * the modes are read in Details and chosen at install time, and a list this
 * mixed has no room for a segmented control on every row.
 *
 * **No `meta` line, on any row.** `SkillRow` put the skill's description there;
 * in a mixed list a metadata line on half the rows makes one list look like
 * two, which is the exact seam this projection exists to remove. Every
 * description, source, format and install date lives in Details — and that is
 * why `SkillRow` is not reused here rather than extended.
 *
 * **The row is the Details control**, as the Add addon result row is the
 * selection control: click, or Enter / Space, opens the dialog. What is left
 * on the right is one tone-coloured flag (an update is available) and the `⋯`
 * menu, whose trigger stops the click so opening it never also opens Details.
 * The source glyph, the published glyph and the info tooltip are gone from the
 * row — the same shape the Add addon list has: name · version · author.
 *
 * Its three writes live in `useAddonRowMutations`, one observer set per row —
 * see that hook for why they are not shared with the card.
