 *
 * A Sheet rather than a route, by P5's route-vs-Sheet test: the list needs no
 * search, sort or pagination, and a file inside an immutable snapshot has no
 * lifecycle of its own — there is nothing to do to one. It is deliberately a
 * list of *names*, not a file browser: the catalog's job is to let a reader
 * decide whether to install a skill, and "it ships three scripts and two
 * references" answers that, while a per-file viewer would make the catalog a
 * general reader over other people's published trees.
 *
 * The one action over this content is the card's download, which takes the
 * whole folder — the same archive an agent installs, so what a reader
 * inspects is what an agent would run.

 *
 * Which is also why the *prefix* is what truncates: `ListRow` truncates the
 * whole title, so a long `references/deep/nested/` would ellipse away the file
 * name — the one thing this row exists to show. The name is `shrink-0` and the
