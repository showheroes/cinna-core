 * - a **connection** — one platform agent wired to another's REST API. Machine
 *   -only, anonymous by construction, shareable.
 * - an **external key** — a value a human copies into a laptop script, a
 *   server, or a cron job. Identity-bound, revealable, and never shareable
 *   (plan D4: sharing an identity-bound key means "here, act as user X").
 *
 * The split is decided by the bound token's ``kind``, resolved here once and
 * used for both which view renders and whether the sharing card exists at all.
 * Neither view is a superset of the other — a key has an identity a connection
 * cannot have, and a connection has consumer agents a key never does.
