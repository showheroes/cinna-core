/**
 * Words for catalog-skill credential slots — the **only** place the surfaces of
 * the skill credential requirements feature read copy from (plan §9.3 S0):
 * Share skill, Add skill to agent, the Add addon wizard, the catalog tile and
 * package card, the Addons row and detail dialog, and the credential impact
 * confirms. One module so the same slot cannot read one way before an install
 * and another way after it (§2 "The same entity, before and after").
 *
 * Every table is a `Record` keyed by the **generated** union, so a value the
 * server adds is a missing key here and fails to compile rather than printing a
 * raw code (the `FORMAT_LABEL` precedent in `utils/addons.ts`). Wire-string
 * fallbacks use `||`: an absent name arrives as `""` as often as `null`.
 *
 * **Two perspectives on `provided_by`.** Every surface that installs a skill or
 * reads a published revision speaks to the *installer* (`PROVIDED_BY_COPY`:
 * "From the publisher", "You provide it"). The Share skill dialog is the one
 * surface whose reader *is* the publisher, where "From the publisher" would
 * name them in the third person and "You provide it" would be false — it reads
 * `PROVIDED_BY_PUBLISHER_COPY` instead ("Shared with installers"), as do the
 * bundle usage rows of a credential's impact dialogs, whose reader is also the
 * publisher. Do not mix the two on a surface.
