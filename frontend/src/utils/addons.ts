 * this, nothing installed it" for both shapes.

 * code (`AddonsService._source_unavailable`): the package, revision or
 * marketplace was deleted, **or** a re-sync re-derived `supported=false` onto
 * an entry this agent already has — upstream moved it to npm, dropped its
 * SKILL.md, or wrote a path that escapes the repo. The sentence therefore
 * cannot assert a disappearance the user can go and disprove; it names the
