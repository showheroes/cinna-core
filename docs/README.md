# Cinna Core

A conversational AI agent platform where users create custom AI agents, run them in isolated Docker environments, and interact through persistent chat sessions. Agents can be shared, scheduled, triggered by email/webhooks, and exposed via A2A and MCP protocols.

**Stack:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL | React + TypeScript + TanStack | Docker isolation | SQLModel ORM

## Core Idea

The platform separates three distinct layers:

- **Agent** (logical definition) — what the agent does: custom prompts, credentials, SDK configuration
- **Environment** (runtime instance) — where it runs: a Docker container with the agent's workspace, tools, and files
- **Session** (conversation) — how users interact: a persistent chat thread with independent message history

One agent can have multiple environments (for testing, production, or rollback via blue-green deployment). One environment can host multiple sessions that share the same file workspace but maintain separate conversation histories.

Agents operate in two modes:
- **Building mode** — development state; agent uses a larger context window, can create/modify scripts and configure integrations
- **Conversation mode** — execution state; agent runs pre-built workflows with a lightweight prompt for faster, cheaper responses

Sessions can be started manually, by automated triggers (CRON, email, webhook), or by other agents via handover. External systems can connect through A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) or MCP (Model Context Protocol).
