## OAuthRefreshService

- `refresh_if_needed(session, credential, *, min_valid_seconds, force=False, raise_on_error=False) -> RefreshOutcome`. Non-Google types and undecryptable blobs are `skipped`. Outcome `status`: `refreshed`, `fresh`, `skipped`, `failed`, `busy`, `cooldown`. Outcomes never contain token values.
- Pre-check (skipped when `force`): token still valid for `min_valid_seconds` -> `fresh`; stored `refresh_error_kind == reauth_required` -> `failed`; `provider_error` within `OAUTH_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` of `refresh_error_at` -> `cooldown`.
- `locked(session, credential, needs_refresh)` - per-credential in-process `asyncio.Lock` plus `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(0x4F415554, key)` on the caller's session (non-blocking try-lock polled every 0.25 s up to 5 s; no blocking `FOR UPDATE`, which would deadlock the event loop). `needs_refresh` is re-evaluated on a re-read after acquiring. States `acquired` / `not_needed` / `busy`. The commit on exit releases the lock. Caller session must have no pending changes.
- Re-auth race guard: the encrypted blob is snapshotted under the lock and re-checked before writing; if the OAuth callback changed it, the stale result is discarded (`fresh`).
- Bookkeeping in the encrypted blob (no migration): `refresh_attempted_at`, `refresh_error`, `refresh_error_kind` (`reauth_required` | `provider_error`), `refresh_error_at`. Cleared on success; the OAuth callback rebuilds the blob so re-authorization clears them. Kept out of the container by `AGENT_ENV_ALLOWED_FIELDS`. Metadata endpoint exposes `refresh_error` and `needs_reauthorization`.
- `access_token_for_env(session, agent_id, credential_id, min_ttl, known_expires_at=None)` - used by the env endpoint (below).
- `AgentEnvTokenError(code, status, message, retry_after=None)` - mapped to HTTP errors by the route.

## Refresh Callers

| Caller | Path |
|---|---|
| Env start, `_sync_dynamic_data`, `sync_credentials_to_agent_environments` | `CredentialsService.prepare_fresh_credentials_for_environment` -> `refresh_expiring_credentials_for_agent` (no events, no recursion, never raises) |
| Every stream turn (UI, channel follow-up, A2A, MCP) | `SessionStreamProcessor._process_inner` after `on_stream_starting`; syncs only if something refreshed |
| Sweep | `sweep_expiring_oauth_credentials` |
| Owner manual | `POST /api/v1/credentials/{id}/oauth/refresh` (`force=True`) |
| Container | env endpoint below |

## Agent-Environment Endpoint

`POST /api/v1/agent/credentials/{credential_id}/access-token` (tag `agent-credentials`, auth `AgentEnvContextDep`: env `AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN` as Bearer + `X-Agent-Env-Id`; `CurrentUser` tokens are rejected).

- Request `AgentCredentialAccessTokenRequest {min_ttl: int = 300, known_expires_at: int | None}` - `min_ttl` clamped to `[0, OAUTH_ON_DEMAND_MAX_MIN_TTL_SECONDS]` (1800); `known_expires_at` is the expiry of the token the env already holds (the SDK sends its local `expires_at`).
- Response `AgentCredentialAccessTokenResponse {access_token, token_type, expires_at, refreshed}`. Never carries the refresh token or bookkeeping.
- Scope: only credentials linked to the calling agent (shared included) and Google OAuth types. Unlinked and nonexistent ids give the same 404.
- Errors, `detail = {"code", "message"}`:

| HTTP | code | When |
|---|---|---|
| 404 | `credential_not_linked` | not linked to the agent / missing |
| 422 | `not_refreshable` | placeholder or non-Google-OAuth type (`mcp_provider` tokens never live in credentials.json) |
| 409 | `reauthorization_required` | never authorized, or Google rejected the refresh token |
| 502 | `provider_error` | Google failure or cooldown; `Retry-After` set |
| 502 | `refresh_in_progress` | another worker holds the refresh lock and the stored token is expired; `Retry-After: 1` |
| 503 | `oauth_not_configured` | Google OAuth not configured on the platform |

- The credentials payload is pushed to the agent's running environments before responding when the call refreshed, or the returned `expires_at` differs from `known_expires_at`, or that field is missing (raw HTTP callers always get a push), so env-core redaction knows the value. A push failure is logged and the response is still 200. Other agents sharing the credential rely on their own sync/sweep.

## Container SDK

`from core.cinna_api import credentials` -> `credentials.access_token(credential_id, *, min_ttl=300) -> str`. Reads `credentials.json` fresh; returns the synced token when `expires_at - now > min_ttl`; otherwise POSTs (stdlib `urllib`; `BACKEND_URL`, `AGENT_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ENV_ID` from the process env) to the endpoint. Platform unreachable but synced token still valid -> returns it with a warning; otherwise `CredentialRefreshError("unavailable", id)`. `min_ttl` is clamped to 1800 client-side too. `refresh_in_progress` is retried once after 1.5 s. HTTP 401/403 raises `unauthorized` (restart/rebuild the env; no local fallback). Other codes mirror the table plus `unavailable`; `str(exc)` is a relayable message. env-core writes `credentials.json` atomically. **Needs env rebuild** (`/app/core` is a per-env copy); the generated credentials README documents a `curl` fallback ("Google OAuth access tokens without Python", sends `min_ttl` only, so it always triggers a push) that works on any environment, and tells agents an `AttributeError` on `credentials.access_token` means the env needs a rebuild.

## Scheduler and Settings

`oauth_refresh_scheduler.py` is scheduled from a background thread and runs `sweep_expiring_oauth_credentials` on the main app event loop (`run_coroutine_threadsafe`), through `leader_session(OAUTH_REFRESH_SWEEP_LOCK_KEY)` so only one worker sweeps at a time. Each run processes all candidates: credentials linked to agents with a running environment, within the threshold of expiry (Google OAuth types and `mcp_provider` `oauth_dcr`). Credentials already in `reauth_required` are skipped without calling Google and are not counted as failures. One bad credential never stops the sweep; refreshed agents are synced. Never started under `settings.TESTING`; started/stopped from `backend/app/main.py`.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OAUTH_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` | 1800 | valid 600..2400; must stay below token lifetime |
| `OAUTH_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | 60 | retry delay after `provider_error` |
| `OAUTH_ON_DEMAND_MAX_MIN_TTL_SECONDS` | 1800 | clamp for endpoint `min_ttl` |
| `OAUTH_REFRESH_SWEEP_ENABLED` | true | |
| `OAUTH_REFRESH_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | 10 | |

## Known Gaps

- `mcp_provider` `oauth_dcr` refresh has no failure cooldown (retried on every sync, start and stream).
