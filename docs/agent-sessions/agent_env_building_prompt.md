# Agent Environment System Prompts

## Overview

Agent environments support two distinct modes, each with tailored system prompts and configurations:

1. **Building Mode**: Development-focused mode for creating workflows, scripts, and configurations
2. **Conversation Mode**: Execution-focused mode for running pre-built workflows and tasks

This document describes the prompt architecture, construction, and usage patterns for both modes.

## Session Modes

### Building Mode

**Purpose**: Develop and configure workflow capabilities

**Model**: Claude Sonnet (default) - Superior code generation and reasoning

**System Prompt**: Claude Code preset + comprehensive documentation

**Use Cases**:
- Create Python scripts for automation
- Configure integrations and credentials
- Update workflow documentation
- Define entry points for scheduled execution

### Conversation Mode

**Purpose**: Execute pre-built workflows and interact with users

**Model**: Claude Haiku - Faster and more cost-effective

**System Prompt**: Workflow-specific instructions (no Claude Code preset)

**Use Cases**:
- Execute tasks using existing scripts
- Process user requests based on workflow capabilities
- Generate reports and summaries
- Interact with APIs and data sources

## Building Mode Prompt Architecture

The building mode system prompt is composed of multiple layers:

1. **Claude Code Preset** (`preset: "claude_code"`)
   - Official Claude Code system prompt with all standard tools and capabilities
   - Provides base functionality for file operations, code editing, and bash commands

2. **BUILDING_AGENT.md** (Static Template)
   - Custom instructions for the building agent role
   - Defines workspace structure (`./scripts/`, `./files/`)
   - Specifies development guidelines (use `uv` for packages, maintain scripts catalog)
   - Located at: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md`

3. **scripts/README.md** (Dynamic Context)
   - Catalog of existing scripts in the workspace
   - Loaded at runtime if file exists and is not empty
   - Provides agent with awareness of what scripts already exist

4. **docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md** (Dynamic Context)
   - System prompt for conversation mode agent
   - Loaded at runtime and included in building mode prompt
   - Agent updates this as workflow capabilities evolve

5. **docs/ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md** (Dynamic Context)
   - Trigger message for workflow execution
   - Loaded at runtime and included in building mode prompt
   - Agent defines concise command to start the workflow

6. **credentials/README.md** (Dynamic Context)
   - Documentation of credentials shared with the agent
   - Redacted sensitive data (shows structure, hides values)
   - Loaded at runtime if file exists and is not empty
   - Provides agent with awareness of available credentials for script development

7. **knowledge/** (Integration Knowledge Base)
   - Directory containing integration-specific documentation organized by topic
   - Only topic folder names are included in the prompt (minimal footprint)
   - Agent reads specific files on-demand when building integrations
   - Example topics: `odoo-erp`, `salesforce`, `stripe`
   - Files contain API guides, data schemas, and best practices

## Workflow Documentation Prompts

The building agent maintains two key documentation files that define how the completed workflow will be used:

### 1. WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md (System Prompt for Conversation Mode)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive system prompt for the conversation mode agent that will execute the workflow.

**Location**: `{instance_dir}/app/docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md`

**Template**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md`

**Content**:
- Agent's role and responsibilities
- Available scripts, APIs, and data sources
- Execution flow and decision-making guidelines
- Database schemas and file formats
- Error handling patterns

**Loading**: `sdk_manager.py::_load_workflow_prompt()` - included in building mode system prompt

**Sync**: `MessageService.sync_agent_prompts_from_environment()` - synced to backend Agent model after building sessions

### 2. ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md (Trigger Message)

**Purpose**: Concise user message (1-2 sentences) that triggers workflow execution.

**Location**: `{instance_dir}/app/docs/ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md`

**Template**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/docs/ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md`

**Content**:
- Short, actionable command (e.g., "Collect from my mailbox unread emails, detect invoices, and give summary")
- NOT a system prompt - this is a user message
- Used for scheduled workflow execution
- Can include parameters or configuration

**Loading**: `sdk_manager.py::_load_entrypoint_prompt()` - included in building mode system prompt

**Sync**: `MessageService.sync_agent_prompts_from_environment()` - synced to backend Agent model after building sessions

### Bidirectional Sync

**From Environment → Backend** (automatic):
- Triggered after building mode sessions complete
- `messages.py` route calls `MessageService.sync_agent_prompts_from_environment()`
- Reads prompts via `docker_adapter.py::get_agent_prompts()` (calls `/config/agent-prompts`)
- Updates `Agent.workflow_prompt` and `Agent.entrypoint_prompt` fields

**From Backend → Environment** (manual):
- User edits prompts in backend UI
- Calls `agents.py::sync_agent_prompts()` route
- Pushes via `docker_adapter.py::set_agent_prompts()` (calls `/config/agent-prompts`)
- Updates files in `{instance_dir}/app/docs/`

### Building Agent Instructions

The building agent sees both prompts in its system prompt and is instructed to:
- Update `WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` as scripts and capabilities are developed
- Fill in `ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md` with a concise trigger message
- Keep both files current as the workflow evolves

**Reference**: `BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md` section "Workflow Documentation"

## File Locations

### Template Files (Version Controlled)

- **BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md`
  - Template for building agent instructions
  - Copied to `BUILDING_AGENT.md` during environment initialization

- **scripts/README.md Template**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/scripts/README.md`
  - Initial empty catalog template
  - Agent maintains this file as scripts are created

### Instance Files (Per Environment)

- **BUILDING_AGENT.md**: `{instance_dir}/app/BUILDING_AGENT.md`
  - Created from BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md during environment setup
  - Can be customized per environment

- **scripts/README.md**: `{instance_dir}/app/scripts/README.md`
  - Dynamically maintained catalog of scripts
  - Updated by agent whenever scripts are created/modified/removed

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Environment Creation

**File**: `backend/app/services/environment_lifecycle.py`

**Method**: `create_environment_instance()`

**Step 3**: `_setup_building_agent_prompt()`
- Copies `BUILDING_AGENT_EXAMPLE.md` → `BUILDING_AGENT.md` to instance directory
- Ensures each environment has its own copy that can be customized

### 2. Prompt Generator Initialization

**File**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/core/server/prompt_generator.py`

**Class**: `PromptGenerator`

**Initialization**:
- Accepts `workspace_dir` path in constructor
- Calls `_load_building_agent_prompt()` to read `/app/BUILDING_AGENT.md`
- Stores content in `self.building_agent_prompt` (cached for reuse)

**Purpose**: Centralized prompt loading and generation logic

### 3. SDK Manager Initialization

**File**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/core/server/sdk_manager.py`

**Class**: `ClaudeCodeSDKManager`

**Initialization**:
- Creates `PromptGenerator` instance with workspace path
- Creates `SessionLogger` instance for debugging
- No direct prompt loading (delegated to PromptGenerator)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate SDK sessions, coordinate with services

### 4. Runtime Prompt Assembly

**Building Mode** (`PromptGenerator.generate_building_mode_prompt()`):
1. Start with cached `self.building_agent_prompt`
2. Call `_load_scripts_readme()` - append scripts catalog if exists
3. Call `_load_workflow_prompt()` - append workflow docs if exists
4. Call `_load_entrypoint_prompt()` - append entry point if exists
5. Return `SystemPromptPreset` dict:
   ```python
   {
       "type": "preset",
       "preset": "claude_code",
       "append": building_prompt  # All docs combined
   }
   ```

**Conversation Mode** (`PromptGenerator.generate_conversation_mode_prompt()`):
1. Call `_load_workflow_prompt()` - main system prompt
2. Call `_load_scripts_readme()` - available scripts
3. Combine into plain string (no preset)
4. Return string prompt

### 5. Request Routing

**File**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/core/server/routes.py`

**Endpoints**: `/chat` and `/chat/stream`

**Logic**:
- Validate `agent_sdk` parameter (currently only "claude" supported)
- Extract `mode` and `agent_sdk` from request
- Call `sdk_manager.send_message_stream()` with mode and SDK parameters
- SDK Manager delegates prompt generation to PromptGenerator
- Model selection happens in SDK Manager based on mode

### 6. Model and Prompt Configuration

**File**: `backend/app/env-templates/python-env-advanced/app/core/server/sdk_manager.py`

**Method**: `send_message_stream()`

**Steps**:
1. Set model based on mode:
   - Conversation: `options.model = "haiku"`
   - Building: Don't set (defaults to Sonnet)
2. Generate system prompt:
   - Call `self.prompt_generator.generate_prompt(mode)`
   - Assign to `options.system_prompt`
3. Create SDK client with configured options
4. Stream responses to frontend

## Key Features

### Dynamic Context Awareness

The agent knows about existing scripts because `scripts/README.md` is loaded fresh on each request. This means:
- Agent sees what scripts were created in previous sessions
- Can update/modify existing scripts intelligently
- Avoids recreating scripts that already exist
- Can maintain the catalog accurately

### Catalog Maintenance Requirement

The prompt explicitly requires the agent to:
- Update `./scripts/README.md` whenever creating/modifying/removing scripts
- Use a specific format (Purpose, Usage, Key arguments, Output)
- Keep descriptions SHORT and ACTIONABLE

### Workspace Organization

The prompt enforces strict organization:
- **All scripts** → `./scripts/`
- **All output files** → `./files/`
- **All packages** → installed via `uv`

## Example Assembled Prompt

When building mode is activated with existing scripts and credentials:

```
[Claude Code Preset System Prompt]

[Content from BUILDING_AGENT.md]
- Role definition
- Workspace structure
- Development guidelines
- Script catalog format
- Common tasks

---

## Existing Scripts in Workspace

The following is the current contents of `./scripts/README.md` which catalogs all existing scripts in this workspace:

```markdown
# Scripts Catalog

## process_data.py
**Purpose**: Process CSV data and generate summary statistics
**Usage**: `python scripts/process_data.py --input data.csv --output summary.json`
**Key arguments**: `--input` (required), `--output` (required)
**Output**: JSON file saved to ./files/
```

**Important**: When you create, modify, or remove scripts, you MUST update this file to keep it accurate.

---

## Available Credentials

The following is the current contents of `./credentials/README.md`:

```markdown
# Available Credentials

## email_imap (my_gmail_account)
- **host**: imap.gmail.com
- **port**: 993
- **login**: user@example.com
- **password**: [REDACTED]
- **is_ssl**: true
```

**CRITICAL SECURITY RULES**:
- **NEVER** read `./credentials/credentials.json` directly in this conversation
- **NEVER** log or print credential values in your messages
- **ONLY** access credentials programmatically in the scripts you create
```

---

## Integration Knowledge Base

If you need specific integration knowledge (APIs, data schemas, best practices),
check `./knowledge/` directory which contains following topics (folders): odoo-erp

Check these folders for documentation files if needed.
```

## Conversation Mode Prompt Architecture

The conversation mode system prompt is lightweight and execution-focused:

### Prompt Components

1. **WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md** (Main System Prompt)
   - Describes workflow's purpose, capabilities, and responsibilities
   - Execution flow and decision-making guidelines
   - Database schemas, file formats, and data structures
   - Error handling patterns and success criteria

2. **scripts/README.md** (Available Tools)
   - Catalog of existing scripts and their usage
   - Appended to system prompt for script awareness
   - Formatted as "Available Scripts" section

3. **credentials/README.md** (Available Credentials)
   - Documentation of credentials shared with the agent
   - Redacted sensitive data (shows structure, hides values)
   - Appended to system prompt for credential awareness
   - Formatted as "Available Credentials" section

4. **knowledge/** (Integration Knowledge Base)
   - Topic folder names listed in prompt for awareness
   - Agent reads specific knowledge files on-demand during execution
   - Provides access to integration documentation when needed

### Differences from Building Mode

**What's EXCLUDED**:
- ❌ Claude Code preset (no development overhead)
- ❌ BUILDING_AGENT.md (no development instructions)
- ❌ ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md (not needed for execution)

**What's INCLUDED**:
- ✅ WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md (workflow-specific instructions)
- ✅ scripts/README.md (available automation tools)
- ✅ credentials/README.md (available credentials with redacted sensitive data)
- ✅ knowledge/ (topic folder names for integration documentation)

**Prompt Format**:
- **Building Mode**: SystemPromptPreset dict (Claude Code + appended docs)
- **Conversation Mode**: Plain string (direct system prompt text)

**Model Selection**:
- **Building Mode**: Default (Sonnet) for code quality
- **Conversation Mode**: Haiku for speed and cost efficiency

### Example Conversation Prompt

```
# Mailbox Invoice Parser Workflow

## Role and Responsibilities
You are an automated invoice extraction and reporting agent...

## Available Scripts
- `scripts/fetch_emails.py`: Connect to email account and retrieve unread emails
- `scripts/detect_invoices.py`: Identify emails containing invoices
- `scripts/extract_invoice_data.py`: Parse invoice documents
- `scripts/generate_summary.py`: Create summary reports

## Available Credentials
- **email_imap** (my_email_account): IMAP access to user@example.com
  - host: imap.gmail.com, port: 993, login: user@example.com, password: [REDACTED]
- **odoo** (erp_system): Odoo ERP API access
  - url: https://erp.example.com, database: production, api_token: [REDACTED]

**IMPORTANT**:
- The information above shows all available credentials
- **DO NOT** read ./credentials/credentials.json directly - use the information above when discussing credentials with users
- Scripts you execute can read ./credentials/credentials.json to access the actual credential data
- Sensitive values (passwords, tokens) are shown as [REDACTED] above but are available to scripts

## Integration Knowledge Base

If you need specific integration knowledge (APIs, data schemas, best practices),
check `./knowledge/` directory which contains following topics (folders): odoo-erp

Check these folders for documentation files if needed.
```

## Implementation

### Module Responsibilities

**PromptGenerator** (`prompt_generator.py`):
- Loads prompt files from workspace and templates
- Constructs mode-specific system prompts
- Caches static prompts for performance

**Key Methods**:
- `generate_building_mode_prompt()`: Returns SystemPromptPreset dict
- `generate_conversation_mode_prompt()`: Returns plain string
- `generate_prompt(mode)`: Factory method routing by mode
- `_get_knowledge_topics()`: Returns comma-separated list of knowledge topic folders

**SDK Manager** (`sdk_manager.py`):
- Coordinates with PromptGenerator for system prompts
- Sets model based on mode (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- Creates SDK client with appropriate configuration

**Agent Environment Service** (`agent_env_service.py`):
- Reads/writes prompt files in workspace
- Provides business logic for prompt management
- Used by HTTP endpoints for prompt sync

### Prompt Loading Flow

**Building Mode**:
1. SDK Manager receives request with `mode="building"`
2. Calls `PromptGenerator.generate_building_mode_prompt()`
3. PromptGenerator loads:
   - `/app/BUILDING_AGENT.md` (cached at initialization)
   - `/app/workspace/scripts/README.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/docs/ENTRYPOINT_PROMPT.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/credentials/README.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/knowledge/` (scans for topic folder names only)
4. Constructs SystemPromptPreset dict with Claude Code preset
5. SDK Manager passes to ClaudeAgentOptions

**Conversation Mode**:
1. SDK Manager receives request with `mode="conversation"`
2. Calls `PromptGenerator.generate_conversation_mode_prompt()`
3. PromptGenerator loads:
   - `/app/workspace/docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/scripts/README.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/credentials/README.md` (fresh load)
   - `/app/workspace/knowledge/` (scans for topic folder names only)
4. Constructs plain string prompt
5. SDK Manager passes to ClaudeAgentOptions

### Model Selection

**Implementation** (`sdk_manager.py`):
```python
# Set model based on mode
if mode == "conversation":
    options.model = "haiku"
    logger.info("Using Haiku model for conversation mode")
# For building mode, don't set model parameter (uses default Sonnet)
```

**Rationale**:
- Conversation mode prioritizes speed and cost (Haiku)
- Building mode prioritizes code quality (Sonnet)
- Model selection automatic based on session mode

## SDK Support

### Agent SDK Parameter

**Purpose**: Support multiple AI SDKs in the future

**Current**: `agent_sdk="claude"` (only option)

**Future**: Can add `"openai"`, `"google-adk"`, etc.

**Request Flow**:
1. Backend creates session with `agent_sdk` parameter
2. Request includes `agent_sdk` in payload to environment
3. Routes.py validates SDK support
4. SDK Manager handles SDK-specific configuration

**Benefits**:
- Extensible architecture for multi-SDK support
- SDK preference stored at session level
- Easy to add new AI providers

## Integration Knowledge Base

### Purpose

The knowledge base provides agents with access to integration-specific documentation, API guides, data schemas, and best practices. This enables agents to build high-quality integrations without requiring the full documentation in the system prompt.

### Structure

**Location**: `{instance_dir}/app/workspace/knowledge/`

**Organization**:
- Topic-based subdirectories (e.g., `odoo-erp/`, `salesforce/`, `stripe/`)
- Markdown files containing integration documentation
- Each topic folder can contain multiple documentation files

**Example Structure**:
```
workspace/knowledge/
├── odoo-erp/
│   ├── general_info.md      # Connection methods, authentication, architecture
│   ├── vendor_bills.md       # Vendor bill fields, workflows
│   └── sales_orders.md       # Sales order operations
├── salesforce/
│   ├── api_guide.md          # API endpoints, authentication
│   └── data_model.md         # Object schemas, relationships
└── stripe/
    └── webhooks.md           # Webhook handling, event types
```

### Minimal Footprint Design

**Key Principle**: Only topic folder names are included in the prompt, not file contents.

**Prompt Addition**:
```
## Integration Knowledge Base

If you need specific integration knowledge (APIs, data schemas, best practices),
check `./knowledge/` directory which contains following topics (folders): odoo-erp, salesforce, stripe

Check these folders for documentation files if needed.
```

**Benefits**:
- Minimal prompt size (3 lines + comma-separated topic names)
- Agent-driven discovery (reads files only when needed)
- Scalable (can add many topics without bloating prompt)
- Fast context loading (no upfront file reading)

### Usage Pattern

**Building Mode**:
1. Agent sees available topics in system prompt
2. When building integration, agent reads relevant knowledge files
3. Agent follows patterns and best practices from documentation
4. Agent implements integration according to guidelines

**Conversation Mode**:
1. Agent aware of knowledge topics
2. Can reference documentation during workflow execution
3. Useful for troubleshooting or extending workflows

### Implementation

**Method**: `PromptGenerator._get_knowledge_topics()`
- Scans `workspace/knowledge/` for subdirectories
- Returns comma-separated list of folder names
- Ignores hidden folders (starting with `.`)
- Lightweight operation (no file reading)

**Loading**: Called during both building and conversation mode prompt generation

### Content Guidelines

Knowledge base files should contain:
- **API Documentation**: Endpoints, authentication, request/response formats
- **Data Schemas**: Field definitions, validation rules, relationships
- **Best Practices**: Architectural patterns, error handling, performance tips
- **Code Examples**: Common operations, edge cases, integration patterns
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business logic, workflows, terminology

### Example Content

**File**: `knowledge/odoo-erp/general_info.md`
- Connection methods (XML-RPC)
- Authentication patterns
- Separation of concerns (OdooClient wrapper)
- Batch processing best practices
- Multi-company awareness
- Error handling patterns

## Benefits

1. **Mode Separation**: Clear distinction between development and execution
2. **Performance**: Haiku provides 2-5x faster responses in conversation mode
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Haiku reduces costs by ~90% for execution tasks
4. **Context Preservation**: Building mode agent knows about existing work
5. **Consistency**: All script development follows the same patterns
6. **Self-Documenting**: Scripts catalog provides built-in documentation
7. **Reusability**: Scripts designed for workflow automation from the start
8. **Maintainability**: Clear structure and documentation requirements
9. **Knowledge Discovery**: Minimal-footprint integration knowledge base enables high-quality integrations without bloating prompts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the prompt system:

- Load and include `requirements.txt` in prompt if it exists
- Include recent error logs to help debug failing scripts
- Add workspace statistics (file counts, script usage metrics)
- Support for multi-language environments (not just Python)
- Multi-SDK support (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- Prompt versioning and change tracking
- A/B testing different prompt structures
