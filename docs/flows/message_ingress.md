# Message Ingress

## Purpose

Something arrives with text in it, and an agent has to answer. The "something" is a person typing in
the web chat, a Google Chat message, an email in a polled mailbox, an A2A JSON-RPC call from another
agent, a Cinna Desktop request, an `send_message` tool call on the App MCP server, an ACP prompt from an external client, an HTTP webhook, a
cron-fired schedule, or a task the user pressed *Execute* on. This flow follows that message from the
moment it hits the process to the moment the agent's reply is standing in the surface it came from —
across a dozen features that each own one slice of the path.

The path has a wide mouth and a narrow throat. Every door does its own transport authentication and
its own admission policy, and then almost all of them converge on `ChannelIngestionService`
(`backend/app/services/sessions/channel_ingestion_service.py`), which turns "who is talking" into a
`Session` row, and on `SessionService.send_session_message` /
`SessionService.initiate_stream`, which turn a message into a stream against the agent's container.
Outbound is deliberately *not* unified: the reply leaves through Socket.IO, an SSE frame, an A2A
`Task`, an MCP tool result, an ACP session update, a Google Chat message patch, or an SMTP queue row, and each of those
lives in its own module. Agent selection is treated here as one stage — its internals are in
[Routing & identity chain](routing_identity_chain.md).

## The flow

### 1. Arrival — four kinds of door

* **Authenticated HTTP.** `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/messages/stream`
  (`backend/app/api/routes/messages.py`, `send_message_stream`) for web chat and guest shares;
  `POST /api/v1/webapp/{token}/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages/stream`
  (`backend/app/api/routes/webapp_chat.py`) for the webapp widget; `POST /api/v1/a2a/{agent_id}/`
  (`backend/app/api/routes/a2a.py`, `_handle_jsonrpc`) and
  `POST /api/v1/external/a2a/agent/{agent_id}/` / `POST /api/v1/external/a2a/identity/{owner_id}/`
  (`backend/app/api/routes/external_a2a.py`).
* **Unauthenticated-by-JWT webhook.** `POST /api/v1/channels/{webhook_token}/inbound`
  (`backend/app/api/routes/server_channels.py`, `channel_inbound`) — Google Chat;
  `POST /agent-hooks/{webhook_id}` (`backend/app/api/routes/agent_hooks.py`) — agent webhooks;
  `POST /api/v1/hooks/{webhook_id}` (`backend/app/api/routes/webhooks.py`) — task triggers.
  All three cap the body before parsing it; the channel route also rate-limits per token
  (`SERVER_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`) before doing any work at all.
* **Polled transport.** `ChannelPollService.poll_enabled_channels`
  (`backend/app/services/server_channels/channel_poll_service.py`) runs every 60 s from
  `channel_poll_scheduler.py`, selects enabled channels whose type declares
  `inbound_mode="polled"`, and calls `EmailChannelAdapter.poll`
  (`backend/app/services/server_channels/adapters/email.py`), which does IMAP `SEARCH UNSEEN` on
  `INBOX` off the loop via `anyio.to_thread`.
* **Platform-internal originator.** `agent_schedule_scheduler.py` and
  `backend/app/services/tasks/task_trigger_scheduler.py` each run a 1-minute APScheduler job;
  `POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/execute` is the human's version of the same thing. All of these are
  gated off in tests by `if not settings.TESTING:` in `backend/app/main.py`.

The App MCP server is a fifth shape: an ASGI mount at `/mcp` (`backend/app/mcp/server.py`) exposing
one tool, `send_message` (`backend/app/mcp/app_tools.py`). It has a `ServerChannel` row, but that
row is a *policy front only* — `backend/app/services/server_channels/adapters/app_mcp.py` declares
`inbound_mode="authenticated"` and implements no transport, and the policy is read inside
`backend/app/mcp/app_token_verifier.py` on every token verification.

### 2. Transport authentication — the sender becomes a platform user

Each door proves the sender differently, and the trust tiers are not equal (stated plainly in the
`app_mcp.py` module docstring):

* Google Chat — `GoogleChatAdapter.verify_inbound` verifies a Google-signed JWT against the
  channel's `project_number`; `sender_email` comes out of that JWT. Failure raises
  `ChannelVerificationError`, which the route maps to a detail-free 403 and which writes a throttled
  `SecurityEvent`.
* Email — `sender_email` comes out of the `From:` header, and is spoofable. The mailbox filter is
  `_is_addressed_to_channel`, which fails closed on empty config.
* A2A — `AccessTokenService.verify_a2a_token` (`backend/app/services/a2a/access_token_service.py`)
  decodes an HS256 `AgentAccessToken` JWT, then re-checks the row's `token_hash` and `is_revoked`
  and stamps `last_used_at`. A plain user JWT is the fallback.
* External A2A — plain `CurrentUser` JWT plus `CurrentClientClaims` (`backend/app/api/deps.py`); no
  A2A access tokens on this surface at all.
* ACP — connector-scoped hashed bearer token, checked by `ACPConnectorService.authenticate` in
  `backend/app/services/acp/connector_service.py`; persistent session metadata also binds the issuing token.
* App MCP — `AppMCPToken` bearer, `token_hash` + `expires_at` + `is_revoked`.
* Guest share / webapp — a short-lived share JWT minted by
  `backend/app/services/sharing/agent_guest_share_service.py`, resolved by `deps.py` into a
  `GuestShareContext` / `WebappChatContext` carrying `agent_id` and `owner_id`.

`ChannelInboundService.process_inbound` states the resulting invariant for both channel transports:
**the caller is the authentication chokepoint** — nothing below re-verifies `inbound.sender_email`.
The result is a `SessionSender` (`backend/app/models/sessions/session_sender.py`): a frozen
`(kind, external_id, display_name, platform_user_id)` built by exactly one constructor per door —
`from_channel`, `from_a2a`, `from_app_mcp`, `from_webui`, `from_guest_share`, `from_task_execution`,
`from_system_trigger`.

### 3. Admission — is this sender allowed to talk to this platform at all

Only the channel pipeline has a full admission stack, and its order is load-bearing
(`channel_inbound_service.py`, `process_inbound`): redelivery dedup (3) → whitelist (4) → user
resolution and optional auto-registration (5) → channel policy (6) → attachments (6.5) → binding
dispatch (7). `ChannelPolicyService.describe`
(`backend/app/services/server_channels/channel_policy_service.py`) evaluates three terms in order —
channel enabled, visibility/grant, the user's own `ChannelUserSetting.is_enabled` (inheriting
`ServerChannel.default_enabled_for_users` when absent). A whitelist miss and a policy denial are
answered with the *verbatim same* text, so the reply is not an oracle.

Note the ordering consequence: policy runs **after** user resolution, so a restricted channel can
auto-register an account and then decline it.

Other doors admit differently. A2A checks `A2AAuthContext.can_access_agent` and, for scoped tokens,
`AccessTokenService.can_use_mode`. External A2A uses `ExternalAccessPolicy.resolve_agent`
(`backend/app/services/external/external_access_policy.py`). Agent webhooks check only
`hmac.compare_digest` on the bearer token. The web-UI route does its own ownership and
building-mode checks inline (`routes/sessions.py`, `routes/messages.py`), and deliberately keeps
them there rather than in the service.

### 4. Inbound attachments become rows before anything else reads them

`ChannelAttachmentService.materialize`
(`backend/app/services/server_channels/channel_attachment_service.py`) sits at step 6.5 — below
verification, dedup, the whitelist, user resolution and the policy gate, because an attachment
handle is attacker-influenced data and fetching one is a network call made on the sender's say-so.
It caps the count *before* any fetch, reuses prior materializations keyed on
`(server_channel_id, thread_key, external_message_id, attachment_index)` stored in
`FileUpload.file_metadata`, validates bytes through
`backend/app/services/files/attachment_limits.py`, and writes `FileUpload` rows with
`status="temporary"` owned by **the sender**, not the session owner. Nothing here raises into the
message; everything that fails becomes a `SkippedAttachment`.

### 5. Agent selection

For a new channel thread, `ChannelInboundService._route_new_thread` calls
`ChannelRoutingService.decide` (`backend/app/services/server_channels/channel_routing_service.py`);
for App MCP, `AppMCPRoutingService.route_message`; for External A2A `identity` targets,
`IdentityRoutingService.route_within_identity`. All of them return an agent id and, when the message
was addressed to a person rather than to one of the caller's own agents, an `IdentityGrant`
(ids only). Every other door already knows its agent. **The decision tree, the traces it writes and
the identity model are [Routing & identity chain](routing_identity_chain.md).** What matters here is
that the grant is a *claim*, re-verified downstream, and that a routed thread is pinned by a
`ChannelThreadBinding` row (`backend/app/models/server_channels/channel_thread_binding.py`) whose
uniqueness constraint on `(server_channel_id, thread_key)` is what resolves concurrent first
messages.

### 6. Session resolve-or-create — the narrow throat

`ChannelIngestionService.ingest_inbound_message` runs three steps and delegates all three:

1. `assert_access(db, agent, sender, policy)` — dispatch by **sender kind**, never by
   `integration_type` (which is metadata). `channel_caller` asserts the three-way invariant
   `agent.owner_id == policy.expected_owner_id == sender.platform_user_id`; the one alternative is
   `ChannelAccessPolicy.identity_grant`, whose three ids are re-read via
   `IdentityService.verify_identity_access` on **every message**, because the routing decision and
   the session creation are separated by a worker hop and the owner may have revoked in between.
   Every refusal raises `ChannelDecline` — a `PermissionError` subclass that exists so
   `_drain_parked` can tell "will never succeed" apart from a transient `OSError`.
2. `resolve_or_create_session(...)` — with a `thread_key` it loads the session and runs
   `_verify_resume_sender`; without one it picks the owner via `_select_session_owner_id` and calls
   `SessionService.create_session`, which binds `Session.environment_id` to
   `agent.active_environment_id` and returns `None` (→ `NoActiveEnvironmentError`) when there isn't
   one. Then `_stamp_new_session` applies the whitelisted post-create columns (`caller_id`,
   `identity_caller_id`, `identity_binding_id`, `identity_binding_assignment_id`) and merges
   `session_metadata_extra`. Any unknown key raises `ValueError`.
3. `SessionService.send_session_message(..., initiate_streaming=True)`.

The `integration_type` written at create is the marker every later stage reads:
`channel_<type>` for server channels, `a2a`, `acp`, `app_mcp`, `identity_mcp`, `external`, `task`,
`schedule`, `webhook`, or `None` for web-UI, guest-share and webapp sessions.

Three doors deliberately do **not** run all of step 1–3: `message/stream` on A2A uses
`assert_access` + `resolve_or_create_session` + `send_session_message(initiate_streaming=False)`
because `SessionStreamProcessor` owns the stream kick; App MCP does the same and then uses raw
`MessageService.create_message`, because `ingest_inbound_message`'s stream kick conflicts with
`stream_and_collect_response`'s session lock; and `POST /api/v1/sessions/` calls only
`resolve_or_create_session`, because there is no message body yet.

ACP is another explicit exception: `backend/app/acp/agent.py` creates an owner-held session with a connector/token binding, persists text through `MessageService.create_message`, and invokes `SessionStreamProcessor` directly under the shared session lock and an ACP advisory lease. It checks the install gate before execution, reuses environment activation, and translates output to ACP updates. It does not invoke the web UI slash-command parser or expose client filesystem/MCP tools.

### 7. Message row, environment readiness, commands

`SessionService.send_session_message` re-validates `chat_session.user_id == user_id`, rebinds a
stale environment via `resolve_and_rebind_session_environment`, and then branches:

* **Slash command** (`CommandService.is_command`) — handled locally with no LLM call, waking a
  suspended env first if the handler needs one. Returns `action="command_executed"` (sync) or
  `action="queued"` (`/run:<name>`, which does stream).
* **Files present and env not running** — `ensure_environment_ready_for_streaming` (120 s) runs
  *before* upload, because `prepare_user_message_with_files` needs a live container.
* Otherwise `MessageService.create_message(role="user", sent_to_agent_status="pending")`.

`SessionService.initiate_stream` then decides *when*: it collects pending messages, generates a
title if the session has none, runs the install-readiness gate, and dispatches on environment
status — `running` refreshes expiring OAuth credentials and spawns
`MessageService.process_pending_messages`; `suspended`/`stopped` starts activation in the background
and writes `Session.interaction_status = "pending_stream"`; anything else just marks pending. The
resume is event-driven: `SessionService.handle_environment_activated` re-calls `initiate_stream` for
every session in that environment sitting on `pending_stream`.

### 8. Streaming into the container

`process_pending_messages` holds the shared per-session `asyncio.Lock` around its **entire** body,
composes the handler, and runs the processor:

```
WebSocketEventHandler                     ← always the primary
   └─ maybe_attach_channel_relay(...)     ← channel sessions only
        └─ CompositeStreamEventHandler(primary, [ChannelRelayEventHandler])
SessionStreamProcessor(...).process()
   collect batches → mark sent → POST {env}/chat/stream → fan out events → on_complete
```

`SessionStreamProcessor` (`backend/app/services/sessions/stream_processor.py`) is the single
pipeline for all four consumers. Each supplies a `StreamEventHandler`: `WebSocketEventHandler`
(Socket.IO room `session_{id}_stream`), `MCPEventHandler`, `A2AStreamEventHandler` (SSE), or a
composite. The processor partitions pending messages into LLM batches and command batches, marks
them all sent before the first batch starts, and for each LLM batch calls
`MessageService.stream_message_with_events`, which POSTs to the container's `/chat/stream` via
`agent_env_connector.stream_chat`.

`CompositeStreamEventHandler` is asymmetric on purpose: a passenger's failure is isolated and
logged, a **primary's** failure is held until the fan-out finishes and then re-raised — because
`WebSocketEventHandler.on_complete` is what clears `interaction_status`, and swallowing it would
leave the web client on a stale "streaming".

### 9. Finalize — the turn gets an identity

At the end of a batch, `MessageService._process_attachments` extracts `<cinna_attach>` paths from
the assembled text, materialises those workspace files into platform storage, strips the tags,
splices `attachment` events into the recorded stream and yields them live (so streaming A2A clients
get a `FilePart`). `_finalize_agent_message` then writes the agent `SessionMessage` — and returns
**the id of the row this batch actually wrote**, which is carried on the terminal `STREAM_COMPLETED`
event as turn identity. Outbound consumers deliver *that* message and never "the newest agent
message in the session".

### 10. The reply goes back out the door it came in

| Door | Delivery |
|---|---|
| Web chat, guest share, webapp | Socket.IO `stream_event` into room `session_{id}_stream`; the POST returns only a handshake from `MessageService.build_stream_response` |
| A2A `message/send` | A2A `Task` built by `DatabaseTaskStore` (`backend/app/services/a2a/a2a_task_store.py`), polled until terminal |
| A2A / External A2A `message/stream` | SSE frames, one JSON-RPC-wrapped A2A event each, mapped by `backend/app/services/a2a/a2a_event_mapper.py`; attachments become `FilePart`s with 1-hour signed backend URLs from `AgentWorkspaceTokenService.create_file_download_token` |
| ACP | WebSocket `session/update` notifications followed by the `session/prompt` result; cancellations interrupt the existing environment stream |
| App MCP | a JSON string `{"response", "context_id", "agent_name"}`; increments go out as MCP progress/log notifications, not as a stream of the answer |
| Google Chat | live: `ChannelStreamRelay` patches one message every ~3 s and *seals* a slice when the draft outgrows the transport limit. Final: `ChannelOutboundService.handle_stream_completed` |
| Email | `EmailChannelAdapter.send_message` enqueues an `OutgoingEmailQueue` row; `EmailSendingService.send_pending_emails` drains it every 2 minutes, `MAX_RETRIES = 3`, no backoff |
| Agent webhook | `{"success": true, "webhook_type", "log_id"}` — the agent's answer is never returned |

The channel exit is event-driven: `backend/app/main.py` registers
`ChannelOutboundService.handle_stream_completed` / `handle_stream_error` /
`handle_stream_interrupted` on the bus, and each gates on
`session.integration_type.startswith("channel_")` after a registry lookup. The handler fires **once
per LLM batch**, and it is wrapped by the **turn delivery ledger**
(`ChannelTurnDelivery`, `backend/app/models/server_channels/channel_turn_delivery.py`;
service `backend/app/services/server_channels/channel_turn_delivery_service.py`): one row per
external message the turn wrote, roles `draft | sealed | final`, written only at boundaries — never
on the rolling ~3 s patches. A `final` row for this batch's agent message means the turn is already
answered, which is where a redelivered `STREAM_COMPLETED` stops. Comparing the sealed rows'
`visible_char_end` + `content_sha256` against the finalized canonical text is the divergence check;
it changes no behaviour, it only makes a silent assumption able to fire.

## Decision points

| Where | Decides on | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| `routes/server_channels.py` `channel_inbound` | token → channel, adapter signature | 404 unknown/disabled, 403 bad signature, 429, 413 |
| `channel_inbound_service.py` `process_inbound` step 3 | `binding.last_external_message_id`, else in-process TTL cache | redelivery acked, or continue |
| `process_inbound` step 4 | `channel.email_whitelist` | denied (fails closed on NULL) or continue |
| `process_inbound` step 5 `_resolve_user` | email → `User`, `channel.auto_register_users` | resolve, auto-create, or deny |
| `channel_policy_service.py` `describe` | enabled → visibility/grant → per-user toggle | granted policy, or the same generic denial |
| `process_inbound` step 7 | `binding.status` | `active` → continue, `pending_install` → park, `failed` → delete and re-route, none → route |
| `channel_control_commands.py` `match_control_command` | exact `/stop` text, no files, outbound configured | interrupt the stream, or fall through |
| `channel_routing_service.decide` / `AppMCPRoutingService` | message text + policy | agent id (+ optional `IdentityGrant`) — see the routing flow |
| `channel_ingestion_service.py` `assert_access` | `sender.kind` + `ChannelAccessPolicy` | return, or `ChannelDecline` |
| `assert_access` `channel_caller` arm | three-way owner invariant, else the re-read grant | own install, identity session, or refusal |
| `_select_session_owner_id` | `sender.kind`, `session_owner_id` / `identity_owner_id` overrides | which user owns the new `Session` |
| `_verify_resume_sender` | `sender.kind` vs the existing row | resume, or refuse (`system_trigger` and `mcp_caller` can never resume here) |
| `session_service.py` `send_session_message` | `CommandService.is_command`, `has_files`, env status | command result, file wait, or plain pending message |
| `session_service.py` `initiate_stream` | install gate, then `environment.status` | `streaming`, `pending` (+ background activation), or `no_pending_messages` |
| `channel_stream_relay.py` `maybe_attach_channel_relay` | feature flag, channel session, binding, `supports_status_notice` | relay attached, or base handler unchanged (email and App MCP always) |
| `channel_outbound_service.py` `handle_stream_completed` | ledger `turn_already_settled`, then relay tail, then `AGENT_MESSAGE_ID_META_KEY` (uuid / explicit `None` / absent) | deliver increment, deliver that row, settle only, or legacy newest-row |

## Where to change what

| If you want to… | Edit | Re-check |
|---|---|---|
| add a new inbound transport | a `ChannelAdapter` subclass under `backend/app/services/server_channels/adapters/` + the registry | its `ChannelCapabilities` (`supports_status_notice` decides whether it gets a streaming relay); `ChannelOutboundService._deliver_ex` |
| add a new sender kind | `SessionSenderKind` + a constructor in `models/sessions/session_sender.py` | all three kind dispatches — `assert_access`, `_select_session_owner_id`, `_verify_resume_sender` — and `get_session_sender`'s reader table |
| stamp a new column at session create | `resolve_or_create_session`'s create-kwarg tuple or `_STAMPABLE_COLUMNS` | every caller passing `extra_session_kwargs`; unknown keys raise |
| change the access rule for one door | that door's `ChannelAccessPolicy`, not the service | `assert_access`'s arm for that kind; the ≥2-callers contract test `backend/tests/architecture/channel_ingestion_callers_test.py` |
| change what the agent receives | `MessageService.collect_pending_batches` / `_build_llm_batch_content` | recovery-context and webapp-context injection in `stream_processor.py`; title generation reads the raw first message, not the assembled batch |
| add a stream consumer | a `StreamEventHandler` implementation + compose it as a passenger | `CompositeStreamEventHandler`'s primary/passenger asymmetry — a passenger must never break the primary |
| change how a channel reply is rendered | `ChannelOutboundService._deliver_ex` / the adapter's `replace_message` | the relay's seal path, and `ChannelTurnDeliveryLedger.settle_turn` (offsets are batch-scoped) |
| gate anything on the send path | `ingest_inbound_message` | it does **not** cover A2A `message/stream`, App MCP, agent webhooks or webapp chat — see the traps |

## Invariants and traps

**One authentication chokepoint per transport, and nothing below re-verifies.** `process_inbound`
says so explicitly. A caller that reaches it with an `inbound` it did not authenticate has voided
the whole module's promise.

**Access is decided by sender kind; `integration_type` is metadata.** The External A2A surface
stamps `integration_type="app_mcp"`/`"identity_mcp"` while building an `a2a_caller` sender, and the
reader `get_session_sender` maps the row back for display. Nothing in `assert_access` reads it.

**An identity grant is a claim, not a conclusion.** `assert_access` re-reads binding, assignment and
all four linkages on every message, and `_select_session_owner_id` refuses an `identity_owner_id`
override unless the grant object is present on the policy — deliberately structural, because
`resolve_or_create_session` is public and a future caller could otherwise commit a session inside a
stranger's workspace with nothing verified.

**A soft `action="error"` is a real failure.** `ingest_inbound_message` reports "no active
environment", "activation failed", "session vanished" and "file preparation refused" as a return
value, not an exception, and every channel caller above decides "delivered or not" by asking whether
something raised. `ChannelInboundService._ingest` converts it to
`ChannelIngestProducedNoMessage` *before* stamping `binding.session_id`; a caller that forgets loses
the sender's message silently, because the next redelivery dedups against the stamp.

**`integration_type` staying `channel_<type>` is load-bearing.** `ChannelOutboundService._resolve_channel_session`
gates on that prefix. A differently-stamped channel session runs perfectly and never delivers.

**Never deliver by recency.** The three states of `AGENT_MESSAGE_ID_META_KEY` — a uuid, an explicit
`None`, and the key absent — are three different instructions. Falling back to the newest agent row
on an explicit `None` re-delivered the *previous* turn's answer into the thread as if it answered
the new question; that is the bug the whole turn-identity mechanism exists to prevent.

**The paths that skip `ingest_inbound_message` are real and are not equivalent.** A2A
`message/stream` uses the two primitives directly (to avoid a double stream kick); App MCP does the
same plus a raw `MessageService.create_message` (session-lock conflict); web-UI/guest-share
`POST /api/v1/sessions/` calls only `resolve_or_create_session` and never `assert_access`, gating in
the route instead; webapp chat calls `SessionService.create_session` directly with no sender at all;
and agent webhooks (`agent_webhook_service.py`) use no `SessionSender`, no `ChannelAccessPolicy` and
no `assert_access` — they are the last trigger path still on the pre-migration primitives. A gate
added to `ingest_inbound_message` silently does not apply to any of them.

**The session-webhook arm queues without kicking.** `_fire_session` creates the session and calls
`MessageService.create_user_message_and_emit_event`, which emits a Socket.IO-only
`user_message_created` (no backend handler consumes it) and leaves `sent_to_agent_status="pending"`.
It never calls `initiate_stream`, and it does not set `interaction_status="pending_stream"`, so
`handle_environment_activated` will not pick it up either. The log status is literally named
"user message queued".

**`system_trigger` is asserted, not fast-pathed.** `allow_system_trigger_fastpath=True` still
requires `policy.expected_owner_id == agent.owner_id == sender.platform_user_id`, and the kind
cannot resume — a `thread_key` reaching the service with it is a caller bug.

**Handover does not use `system_trigger`, despite the docs.** The only two production callers of
`SessionSender.from_system_trigger` are both in `agent_schedule_scheduler.py` and both pass
`trigger_kind="schedule"`; `trigger_kind="handover"` appears only in
`backend/tests/unit/models/test_session_sender.py`. Runtime handover
(`AgentService.create_agent_task`) creates an `InputTask` with `auto_execute=True` and goes through
`InputTaskService.execute_task`, i.e. **`task_executor`** with `integration_type="task"`.

**`Session.email_thread_id` and `Session.sender_email` are dead write paths.** `create_session`
documents both: no caller passes them, historical rows still carry values, and email thread state
now lives on `ChannelThreadBinding.thread_key`.

**Neither poll loop takes a lock.** `channel_poll_scheduler.py` documents the multi-process race
explicitly (IMAP `\Seen` + `external_message_id` dedup is a race, not a guarantee) and warns
*against* copying the advisory-lock leader pattern from `model_discovery_scheduler`, which leaks
pooled connections. The task-trigger and agent-schedule loops are plain `SELECT` + in-loop `await`
with no `SKIP LOCKED`, and the email outbound queue has no claim column either.

**Assistant text is coalesced at finalize.** `_coalesce_assistant_events` merges runs of consecutive
`assistant` events because some SDK adapters flush on every newline — which, unmerged, splits code
fences.
