"""Cinna local agent kit tool.

Standard library only, Python 3.10+. No install step, no third-party imports.
Run it with ``uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py …``: the inline script metadata above
lets uv pick (and if needed download) a compatible interpreter, so the macOS system
``python3`` (3.9) is never a blocker. A bare ``python3`` works too when it is 3.10+.

Commands
--------
  new <slug> [--name N] [--description S] [--root DIR] [--json]
                                       scaffold Local/<slug>/ from templates/agent/
  validate <path> [--fix] [--json] [--cloud-ready]
                                       check an agent is coherent and cloud-ready
  list [--root DIR]                    table of local agents and their ladder rungs
  refresh [--check]                    compare / update the kit from the platform
  export <path> --to DIR [--force] [--hash]
                                       produce the cloud-import tree
  chat <path> "<prompt>"               send one prompt to the agent through Cinna
                                       Desktop's local API, and print its answer

Exit codes: 1 when the command failed or `validate` found errors, 0 otherwise
(warnings never fail a run; neither does an unreachable platform on `refresh`).

Never prints a credential value. Findings name the offending file or key only.

    re-stamped therefore carries its stale `cloud` block to the cloud. That is
    accepted: there is no secret in it, and the remedy is the re-stamp.

    Migrating moves the folder's `content_hash` exactly ONCE, which is correct —
    the folder genuinely changed, and a single visible, explainable move is the
    opposite of the perpetual drift that storing the hash inside the hashed file
    produced.

    Two keys move into `publications.json`:

    * `publications` — removed from the manifest schema by R4. A manifest still
      carrying it is reported by `validate`; this is where the report becomes
      actionable.
    * `cloud` — deprecated since contract 1.0.0, one entry's worth of the same
      information in the older shape.

    A ledger key this build cannot READ (not an object, not an array) is LEFT IN
    PLACE rather than dropped. The fail-safe direction is derived from the
    consequence, not copied from D15: discarding data a host cannot interpret is
    unrecoverable, while leaving a deprecated key is visible — `validate` names
    it on every run.

    A key this build cannot PLACE is left in place for the same reason, and that
    is the harder half. The `del`s below used to be conditional on the value's
    TYPE and never on the migration's OUTCOME, so a `cloud` block with no
    `platform_url` was deleted from the manifest while `absorb` declined to
    record it: the `agent_id` simply ceased to exist. Type is what the fail-safe
    was originally applied to; a value's *destination* is the thing that actually
    has to be reached before the source may be removed.

    Migration is therefore all-or-nothing per key. Absorbing the good half of a
    `publications` array and keeping the array for the bad half would duplicate
    the good entries across two files, so an array with one unplaceable entry
    moves nothing and stays whole.

    A declared list is returned **as declared**, entries this build cannot read

    away: `is_secret_filename` treats an unreadable rule as "assume it protects
    something" and withholds everything, and its docstring says so — but no
    unreadable rule could ever reach it, because this function had already
    dropped it. A shortened rule list is a NARROWER secret gate, reported as a
    healthy one, on the one list whose failure mode is a credential leaving the
    machine. Two guards on the same data, one lifted for the caller's benefit and
    lowered here: the filter goes, and the consumer's fail-safe becomes reachable.

    **This function and `contract_exclude_patterns()` fail in OPPOSITE
    directions, on purpose. Do not harmonise them.** Here, a rule this build
    cannot evaluate withholds the FILE (`is_secret_filename` treats it as

    **Why this is a THIRD condition and not the export's `unreadable[]`.** There
    are three ways this tool can be blind to part of an agent folder, and they
    are deliberately kept apart because they fail at different stages, with
    different consequences, and only two of them are about the export at all:

    1. **A file whose bytes will not read** — `hash_export_files`' list. The file
       IS in the export set and travels; per D7 the digest folds it in as
       `UNREADABLE_MARKER`, so the number is stable and comparable but does not
       describe the bytes. Settled by the HASH, over a finished file list.
    2. **A directory the export walk cannot scan** — `collect_export_tree`'s
       list. Files that should travel are ABSENT from the set entirely, so the
       upload is short a subtree and the hash covers a smaller list than any
       other host's. Settled by the WALK, before a file list exists.
       (1) and (2) cannot share one list: a single list could not be acted on
       until after the hash, which is later than the point at which (2) is
       already known to make the answer unusable, and later than `cmd_export`'s
       decision not to `mkdir`. Nor can they share one message — "the hash does
       not describe the bytes" and "files are missing from the upload with
       nothing saying so" are different facts, and one sentence cannot state
       both truthfully. Their POLICY is identical, and that is the part that must
       not diverge: refuse, and `--force` waives neither.
    3. **A directory `validate` reads that the export never touches** — this
       function. It cannot join (2), and the reason is load-bearing rather than
       incidental: (2)'s walk never descends into an EXCLUDED directory, which is
       exactly what makes an unreadable `credentials/` cost the export nothing.
       Widening it to cover `credentials/` would break that property to fix a
       problem the export does not have. But `validate` DOES read there —
       `credentials/.env.example` is a required file and `app-data/storage/`
       holds the status file — and `Path.is_file()` swallows ENOENT while
       PROPAGATING EACCES, so before this existed those two reads left the whole
       command on `main()`'s `(OSError, json.JSONDecodeError)` backstop, printing
       a bare `error: [Errno 13] Permission denied: …/credentials/.env.example`.
       That backstop turns a traceback into a tidy line; it is not a diagnosis,
       and a tidy line is the thing most easily mistaken for one.

    So: three conditions, three lists, three messages, one policy. This one lands
    on `validate` (`export` inherits it, because `cmd_export` validates first).

    Not covered here, deliberately: an entry whose TYPE cannot be stat'd. `os.walk`
    treats it as a file, so it reaches `_validate_secrets` as a name — which is all
    that check reads — and the export walk records it separately in (2).

    # file that could not be read invents findings (an unreadable
    # WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md would be reported as an EMPTY one, which moves the
    # reader from neutral to wrong — worse than the bare errno it replaces), and

    # file would silently escape every `except OSError` already standing around
    # them. So the handler goes where the CHECK boundary already is.

    # Missing and unreadable are the same class of fact — the content is not
    # available — but NOT the same class structurally, which is why they are
    # handled in different places. A missing file is knowable before the read, by
    # a total predicate every caller already uses (`is_file()`), so those callers
    # skip the read and report one finding. An unreadable file is knowable ONLY
    # by attempting the read, from inside whichever helper attempted it, so the
    # nearest boundary that can both name it and carry on is the check itself.
    #
    # The granularity is the CHECK, not the file, and the difference is real:
    # one check is lost per failure and the other eight still run, but two
    # unreadable files read by the SAME check yield one ERROR naming the first,
    # and the second appears on the next run. Verified: with `pyproject.toml`,
    # `Makefile`, `docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` and `docs/CLI_COMMANDS.yaml` all
    # unreadable, three ERRORs are reported — `Makefile` is masked because
    # `_validate_commands` reaches the YAML first. Do not describe this as
    # "one pass names every permission"; it names one per failing check.
    #
    # `OSError` only: a check that raises anything else is a genuine bug, and a
    # traceback for that is information. No sub-validator raises `KitError`, so
    # nothing here is being swallowed. This does NOT lean on `main()`'s

    list, and it exists because the two failures have the SAME consequence —
    part of the tree was never seen — at two levels of one walk.

    on it unconditionally, `cmd_export` with the listing. An EXCLUDED directory
    is never descended into, so an unreadable `credentials/` costs nothing: the
    list only ever names a subtree that would have travelled.

    Three details of the walk are load-bearing and none of them is what
    `iter_files` does:

    - **Symlinks are never followed and never listed**, files and directories
      alike: a folder that travels must not be able to reach outside itself.
    - **Excluded directories are never descended into**, so `credentials/` costs
      one match rather than one per file.
    - **Dotfiles are walked.** They are dropped by the patterns, not by the walk.
      `iter_files` hard-skips `SKIP_DIRS`, which is a *different* set from the
      contract's and would make this host's hash disagree with every other
      host's the moment the two lists drift apart.

    On top of the patterns it applies the contract's `secret_files` rule, which
    globs cannot express. That filter belongs HERE, in the one walk, rather than
    at copy time: `content_hash` must describe the set that actually travels, or
    editing a withheld secret moves the hash for a change that can never be
    published — "unpublished changes" that no publish can ever clear.
