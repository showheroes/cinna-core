# Agent MCP Connector — Architecture Overview

## What It Does

Exposes platform agents as **remote MCP servers** so that any MCP-compatible client — Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot — can connect to an agent and interact with it as a tool provider. The MCP client sends tool calls, the agent processes them via its environment (Docker container running Google ADK / Claude Code), and results stream back over the MCP protocol.

This is the MCP counterpart of our A2A integration. While A2A is agent-to-agent task delegation (JSON-RPC), MCP is tool-use — an AI client calls our agent as a tool. Both share the same underlying infrastructure (SessionService, MessageService, agent environments), but speak different protocols at the API boundary.

### Why MCP

- **Universal client support** — Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, Cursor, and others already support adding remote MCP servers
- **Zero-config for the user** — paste one URL into the MCP client; it auto-discovers OAuth, auto-registers, handles auth
- **OAuth-based auth** — standardized authentication, no manual token management
- **Richer than chat** — MCP supports tools, resources, and prompts (not just messages)

### AS/RS Separation

The architecture separates OAuth into two distinct roles:

| Role | Implementation | URL Space |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Authorization Server (AS)** | Our own FastAPI routes | `/mcp/oauth/...` (shared, one set of endpoints for all connectors) |
| **Resource Server (RS)** | One MCPServer instance per connector, using TokenVerifier | `/mcp/{connector_id}/...` (per-connector) |

**Why this split:**
- The MCP SDK binds `issuer_url` and `resource_server_url` per MCPServer instance — a single instance can't serve different connectors
- Each connector needs its own `resource_server_url` (token audience), but all connectors share one OAuth endpoint set
- The SDK auto-generates `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` per connector, pointing to the shared AS
- Our FastAPI OAuth routes handle all authorization logic — DCR, authorize, token exchange, revocation

---

## Core Concepts

### MCP Connector

An **MCP Connector** is a named, scoped access point that exposes an agent as an MCP server. It is the MCP equivalent of an A2A access token or a guest share link.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **name** | Display name (e.g., "Cursor - conversation", "Claude Desktop - building") |
| **mode** | `conversation` or `building` — controls which agent mode MCP sessions use |
| **is_active** | Enable/disable without deletion |
| **allowed_emails** | Email addresses allowed to authenticate (empty = owner only) |
| **max_clients** | Maximum DCR client registrations allowed (default 10) |
| **MCP Server URL** | `{MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL}/{connector_id}/mcp` — the only thing the user copies |

**Why multiple connectors?** Different MCP clients may need different permission levels:
- A "conversation" connector for quick tasks (cheaper, faster)
- A "building" connector for development work (full tool access)
- Separate connectors for different users or teams (each with its own email list and session isolation)

### Email-Based Access Control

Access to a connector is controlled by an `allowed_emails` list, not by URL secrecy:

- **Owner always has access** — bypasses the email check
- **Empty list = owner only** — default, most restrictive
- **Explicit sharing** — owner adds email addresses to grant access
- **Checked during OAuth consent** — unauthorized users cannot obtain tokens even if they have the URL
- **Revocable without URL change** — remove an email to revoke access; no need to re-create the connector

This is more secure than URL-as-security-boundary because URLs can leak inadvertently (browser history, chat logs, screenshots), while the email list gives explicit, auditable control.

### Mapping MCP Primitives to the Platform

| MCP Primitive | Platform Mapping |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Tool** (`send_message`) | Send a message to the agent, receive a JSON response with `response` and `context_id` |
| **Tool** (`get_file_upload_url`) | Get a temporary CURL command to upload a file to the agent's workspace |
| **`context_id`** | Platform Session UUID — echoed by LLM to maintain per-chat continuity |
| **MCP Session** | Transport-level session (shared across chats); stored as metadata, not used for routing |
| **Resource** (`workspace://{folder}/{path}`) | Individual workspace files from `files/`, `uploads/`, `scripts/` — dynamically listed |
| **Notification** (`resources/list_changed`) | Sent after `send_message` completes and after file uploads to trigger client resource re-fetch |
| **Notification** (`notifications/progress`) | Progress updates during `send_message` streaming — phase labels (Thinking, Processing, Using tool: X) with monotonic progress 0→100 |
| **Notification** (`notifications/message` / log) | Partial content streaming during `send_message` — assistant response chunks sent via `ctx.info()`, throttled at 0.5s |
| **Prompt** (`prompts/list`, `prompts/get`) | Agent example prompts — defined as `slug: text` lines on the agent model, exposed as MCP slash commands |

### Resource Design

The agent exposes workspace files as **MCP resources**, allowing clients to browse and read files from safe workspace folders.

**URI scheme:** `workspace://{folder}/{path}` — e.g., `workspace://files/report.csv`, `workspace://scripts/run.sh`

**Dynamic listing:** The `resources/list` response is generated dynamically by fetching the workspace tree from the agent environment and enumerating all files in allowed folders. This ensures Claude Desktop and other MCP clients that only read `resources/list` (not `resources/templates/list`) can see every file. If the environment is not running, the list gracefully returns empty.

**Security:** Only `files`, `uploads`, and `scripts` folders are exposed. Sensitive folders (`credentials/`, `databases/`, `docs/`, `knowledge/`, `logs/`) are excluded. File reads are capped at 10MB.

**Content handling:** Text files (`.md`, `.py`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.txt`, etc.) are returned as `TextResourceContents`. Binary files (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.) are returned as `BlobResourceContents` (base64-encoded by the MCP SDK).

**Multi-segment paths:** The custom `WorkspaceResourceManager` subclass handles nested paths like `scripts/sub/folder/run.sh` that the default SDK template matching (which uses `[^/]+` regex) cannot match.

### Prompt Design

The agent exposes **example prompts** as MCP prompts, allowing clients like Claude Desktop to show them as slash commands or suggestions.

**Agent model field:** `example_prompts: list[str]` — each line follows the format `slug: prompt text`. Example:
```
report_status: Send me status report for the current month
check_email: Check my email for urgent items
```

**MCP mapping:**
- `prompts/list` → returns each line as a `Prompt` with `name=slug`, `description=prompt_text`
- `prompts/get` → returns a single user message: `[{role: "user", content: {type: "text", text: prompt_text}}]`

**Dynamic resolution:** Like resources, prompts are fetched from the database on every `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` call. Updates to `example_prompts` take effect immediately without server restart or cache eviction.

**Parsing rules:**
- Lines with `:` → split on first colon: slug (before) and prompt text (after)
- Lines without `:` → full line used as both name and text
- Empty lines are skipped

**Configuration:** Agent owners edit example prompts via the "Example Prompts" button in the agent's Config tab (Information card). The frontend sends the list as `example_prompts: [...]` via the standard agent update endpoint.

### Resource Change Notifications

The MCP server sends `notifications/resources/list_changed` after agent work and file uploads so clients automatically re-fetch the workspace resource list.

**Capability:** The server advertises `"resources": {"listChanged": true}` during the MCP initialize handshake via patched `create_initialization_options()`.

**Notification flow:**
```
send_message tool call:
  Client -> Server: tools/call "send_message"
    -> request handler streams response from agent
  Server -> Client: tool result (response JSON)
  Server -> Client: notifications/resources/list_changed  ← new
  Client -> Server: resources/list (re-fetch)

File upload:
  Client uploads via POST /mcp/{connector_id}/upload
    -> upload_routes proxies to agent-env
  Server -> ALL Client(s): notifications/resources/list_changed  ← new
  Client(s) -> Server: resources/list (re-fetch)
```

**Session tracking:** The registry tracks active `ServerSession` objects per connector (`register_session`/`get_sessions_for_connector`). The `send_message` tool wrapper registers `ctx.session` after each call, enabling the upload route (which lacks direct MCP session access) to broadcast to all connected clients via `broadcast_resource_list_changed()`.

**Design decisions:**
- **Always notify** rather than comparing workspace trees before/after — false positives are harmless, false negatives mean stale views
- **Non-fatal** — all notification errors are caught and logged at debug level; they never affect tool responses or upload results
- **Per-session exception isolation** — `broadcast_resource_list_changed` catches exceptions per session so one disconnected client doesn't block others

### Progress & Content Streaming Notifications

During `send_message` processing, the handler sends MCP notifications so clients can show real-time progress instead of a spinner. This uses two MCP notification mechanisms:

**Progress notifications (`notifications/progress`):**
- Sent via `ctx.report_progress(progress, total, message)` from the MCP SDK's `Context` object
- Client must include `_meta.progressToken` in the request to receive these; if absent, `report_progress` is a silent no-op
- Progress increments by 10 per streaming event, capped at 100 (monotonically increasing per MCP spec)
- Phase labels identify what the agent is doing: "Preparing agent environment...", "Thinking...", "Processing...", "Using tool: {name}"

**Log notifications (`notifications/message`):**
- Sent via `ctx.info(content)` — always works, no token needed
- Streams partial assistant response content to the client
- Throttled to every 0.5s to avoid flooding

**Notification flow during `send_message`:**
```
Client -> Server: tools/call "send_message"
  Server -> Client: notifications/progress (0/100, "Preparing agent environment...")
  [environment readiness check]
  Server -> Client: notifications/progress (10/100, "Thinking...")
  Server -> Client: notifications/progress (20/100, "Processing...")
  Server -> Client: notifications/message (info: "First part of the response...")
  Server -> Client: notifications/progress (30/100, "Using tool: Bash")
  Server -> Client: notifications/progress (40/100, "Processing...")
  Server -> Client: notifications/message (info: "Second part of the response...")
  [progress caps at 100; further events don't send progress]
Server -> Client: tool result (complete JSON response)
Server -> Client: notifications/resources/list_changed
```

**Design decisions:**
- **Purely additive** — the final tool result is unchanged; notifications are extra
- **Non-fatal** — all notification errors are caught and logged at debug level; they never affect the tool response
- **Graceful degradation** — if the client doesn't support progress tokens or log notifications, everything still works
- **No forced completion** — progress is not forced to 100 at the end; the tool result itself signals completion

### Tool Design

The agent exposes two tools:

**`send_message(message, context_id)`** — Send a message to the agent and receive a response. Returns a JSON object with `response` and `context_id` fields.

**`get_file_upload_url(filename, workspace_path)`** — Get a temporary CURL command with a short-lived JWT to upload a file to the agent's workspace.

**Per-chat session isolation via `context_id`:**
- On the first call in a new chat, `context_id` is empty → a new platform session is created → the response includes the session's `context_id` (its UUID)
- On subsequent calls, the LLM passes back the `context_id` from the previous response → the same session is reused
- A new chat = fresh LLM context = no `context_id` = new session

This solves a fundamental problem: Claude Desktop (and similar MCP clients) reuse a single MCP transport session (`mcp-session-id`) across all chats. Without `context_id`, all chats would land in the same platform session. The `context_id` parameter lets us distinguish chats even when the transport session is shared.

### Service Layer Architecture

The tool handler follows the same isolation pattern as `A2ARequestHandler`. All OAuth and connector logic is delegated to the service layer:

```
tools.py (thin MCP entry point — tool handlers)
    ├─ Extract MCP context vars (connector_id, mcp_session_id)
    ├─ MCPConnectorService.resolve_connector_context() → (connector, agent, environment)
    │   └─ Raises: ConnectorNotFoundError, ConnectorInactiveError, AgentNotAvailableError, EnvironmentNotFoundError
    └─ MCPRequestHandler.handle_send_message(message, mcp_session_id, context_id, mcp_ctx)
            ├─ SessionService.get_or_create_mcp_session(context_id=...)
            ├─ MessageService.create_message()
            ├─ mcp_ctx.report_progress(0, 100, "Preparing agent environment...")
            ├─ SessionService.ensure_environment_ready_for_streaming()
            ├─ MessageService.stream_message_with_events()
            │   └─ _send_mcp_progress() per event → report_progress + ctx.info
            └─ Return JSON: {"response": "...", "context_id": "<session_uuid>"}

oauth_routes.py (thin OAuth route handlers)
    ├─ All routes delegate to MCPOAuthService or MCPConsentService
    ├─ MCPOAuthService (register_client, create_authorization, exchange_authorization_code, refresh_access_token, revoke_token)
    │   └─ Raises: ConnectorNotFoundError, ConnectorInactiveError, InvalidClientError, InvalidGrantError, MaxClientsReachedError
    └─ MCPConsentService (get_consent_details, approve_consent)
        └─ Raises: AuthRequestNotFoundError, AuthRequestExpiredError, AuthRequestUsedError, MCPPermissionDeniedError

notifications.py (resource change notifications)
    ├─ notify_resource_list_changed(session) → session.send_resource_list_changed()
    └─ broadcast_resource_list_changed(connector_id) → notify all sessions via registry

resources.py (MCP resource handlers)
    ├─ WorkspaceResourceManager (custom ResourceManager subclass)
    │   ├─ list_resources_async() → dynamic file enumeration from workspace tree
    │   └─ get_resource() → intercepts workspace:// URIs for multi-segment paths
    ├─ _get_adapter_for_connector() → resolve context var → adapter
    ├─ _collect_files_from_tree() → walk tree, extract files from allowed folders
    └─ _read_workspace_file(path) → adapter.download_workspace_item() → str | bytes

prompts.py (MCP prompt handlers)
    ├─ _get_agent_example_prompts() → resolve context var → connector → agent → example_prompts
    ├─ _parse_prompt_line(line) → (slug, prompt_text) | None
    └─ register_mcp_prompts(server) → patches prompts/list and prompts/get handlers
```

**Key principles:**
- No direct database queries in `MCPRequestHandler` — all data access goes through `SessionService` and `MessageService`, matching the A2A handler pattern
- All OAuth and connector validation delegates to service layer; route handlers are thin wrappers that convert domain exceptions (`MCPError` subclasses from `mcp_errors.py`) to HTTP responses
- Domain exceptions carry `status_code` for direct HTTP conversion via `_handle_mcp_error()` helpers

The MCP client handles the entire flow automatically — the user only pastes the URL.

### OAuth Endpoints (Shared AS)

| Endpoint | Purpose | Standard |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `GET /mcp/oauth/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | AS metadata — clients discover all endpoints | RFC 8414 |
| `POST /mcp/oauth/register` | Dynamic Client Registration — MCP clients auto-register | RFC 7591 |
| `GET /mcp/oauth/authorize` | Authorization — stores request, redirects to frontend consent | OAuth 2.1 |
| `POST /mcp/oauth/token` | Token exchange — auth code → tokens, refresh → new token | OAuth 2.1 |

### Per-Connector Endpoints (RS, SDK-managed)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /mcp/{connector_id}/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | Points MCP client to the shared AS (auto-generated by SDK) |
| `POST /mcp/{connector_id}/mcp` | MCP Streamable HTTP — tool calls, JSON-RPC |
| `GET /mcp/{connector_id}/mcp` | SSE stream for server-initiated notifications |
| `DELETE /mcp/{connector_id}/mcp` | Terminate MCP session |

### Token Model

Tokens are **opaque strings** (not JWTs) stored in the database:

| Token Type | Expiry | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Access token | 1 hour | Bearer token on MCP requests |
| Refresh token | 30 days | Exchange for new access token |

Database-backed tokens enable immediate revocation (no waiting for JWT expiry) and are validated via lookup on each MCP request. The TokenVerifier additionally checks:
- Token not expired or revoked
- Token's connector matches the connector being accessed (cross-connector isolation)
- Connector is still active

### Consent Flow

When the OAuth `/authorize` endpoint is hit:

1. Backend stores the full OAuth request server-side (keyed by random nonce) — prevents parameter tampering
2. Redirects to frontend: `/oauth/mcp-consent?nonce={nonce}`
3. Frontend fetches consent details via API — shows agent name, connector mode, client name, scopes
4. User logs in (if needed) and approves
5. Backend checks email ACL (owner or in `allowed_emails`) and issues auth code
6. Browser redirects back to MCP client with auth code
7. MCP client exchanges code for tokens

## Session & Message Flow

### MCP ↔ Platform Session Mapping

```
MCP Client connects (initialize → Mcp-Session-Id assigned by SDK)
    │
    ├─ resources/list → Returns dynamic list of workspace files [workspace://files/data.csv, ...]
    ├─ resources/templates/list → Returns [workspace://files/{path}, workspace://uploads/{path}, ...]
    ├─ resources/read("workspace://files/data.csv") → File content (text or base64)
    │
    ├─ prompts/list → Returns agent example prompts [{name: "report_status", description: "..."}, ...]
    ├─ prompts/get("report_status") → {messages: [{role: "user", content: {text: "..."}}]}
    │
    ├─ tools/list → Returns [send_message(message, context_id), get_file_upload_url(filename, workspace_path)]
    │
    ├─ Chat 1: tools/call "send_message" {message: "...", context_id: ""}    ← first call
    │   │
    │   ├─ tools.py: extract context vars, resolve entities
    │   ├─ MCPRequestHandler.handle_send_message(context_id=""):
    │   │   ├─ SessionService.get_or_create_mcp_session(context_id=None) → create new
    │   │   ├─ MessageService.create_message() (user message)
    │   │   ├─ Stream response from agent environment
    │   │   └─ Return JSON: {"response": "...", "context_id": "<session-uuid-A>"}
    │   └─ LLM receives context_id, stores in its context window
    │
    ├─ Chat 1: tools/call "send_message" {message: "...", context_id: "<session-uuid-A>"}
    │   │                                                                ← LLM echoes it back
    │   ├─ MCPRequestHandler: look up session by context_id → found → reuse
    │   └─ Same session, conversation continues
    │
    ├─ Chat 2: tools/call "send_message" {message: "...", context_id: ""}
    │   │                                     ← new chat = fresh LLM context = no context_id
    │   ├─ MCPRequestHandler: no context_id → create new session
    │   └─ Return JSON: {"response": "...", "context_id": "<session-uuid-B>"}
    │
    └─ Chat 1 and Chat 2 are fully isolated despite sharing the same MCP transport session
```

**Key behaviors:**
- Session lookup is driven exclusively by `context_id` (the platform session UUID)
- `mcp_session_id` (MCP transport session) is stored as metadata but NOT used for session routing — Claude Desktop reuses the same transport session across all chats, so it cannot distinguish them
- `context_id` is cross-connector verified: a context_id from connector A is rejected on connector B
- Invalid/garbage `context_id` values gracefully create a new session
- Session belongs to the connector owner (like guest sessions)
- Agent environment auto-starts if suspended/stopped (via `ensure_environment_ready_for_streaming`)
- Sequential message processing with per-session locking (concurrent calls rejected)
- `mcp_token.user_id` tracks who authenticated (audit trail)
- Same service layer isolation as A2A: `MCPRequestHandler` delegates to `SessionService`/`MessageService` (no direct DB queries)

## URL Scheme & Configuration

### Routing Table

| URL Pattern | Handler | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `/mcp/oauth/...` | Our FastAPI routes | Shared OAuth AS (metadata, DCR, authorize, token, revoke) |
| `/mcp/{connector_id}/.well-known/...` | SDK auto-generated | Protected Resource Metadata |
| `/mcp/{connector_id}/mcp` | SDK MCPServer (per-connector) | MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint |
| `/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/mcp-connectors/...` | Our FastAPI routes | Connector CRUD (frontend management) |
| `/api/v1/mcp/consent/{nonce}` | Our FastAPI routes | Consent page API |

**Important:** The `/mcp/` routes are for external MCP clients only. The frontend manages connectors via `/api/v1/` endpoints.

### `MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL` Configuration

All externally-facing MCP URLs are derived from one config variable:

| What | URL |
|------|-----|
| MCP Server URL (user copies this) | `{MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL}/{connector_id}/mcp` |
| AS Metadata | `{MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL}/oauth/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
| OAuth authorize / token / register | `{MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL}/oauth/...` |
| Token audience (resource param) | `{MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL}/{connector_id}/mcp` |

**Production (dedicated subdomain):**
```
MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://mcp.domain.com
```
nginx proxies `mcp.domain.com` → `backend:8000/mcp/`

**Local development (tunnel):**
```
MCP_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://abc123.a.free.pinggy.link/mcp
```
Tunnel forwards to `localhost:8000/mcp/`

## Frontend

### Connector Management (Integrations Tab)

The **MCPConnectorsCard** lives in the agent's Integrations tab alongside A2A, Access Tokens, Email, and Guest Share cards.

**Features:**
- Create connector: name, mode (conversation/building), allowed emails
- List connectors with status badges (active/inactive), mode badges
- Copyable MCP Server URL (the one thing users paste into their MCP client)
- Allowed emails display as badges
- Toggle active/inactive, delete with confirmation

### OAuth Consent Page

Public route at `/oauth/mcp-consent` (outside normal auth guard):
- Displays: agent name, connector name/mode, client name, requested scopes
- Redirects to login if unauthenticated
- Authorize / Deny buttons
- On approval → redirects to MCP client's callback with auth code

---

## How It Fits With Other Integrations

| Aspect | A2A | MCP | Guest Sessions |
|--------|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Protocol** | A2A JSON-RPC | MCP JSON-RPC (standard) | WebSocket + REST |
| **Auth** | Bearer JWT (custom tokens) | OAuth 2.1 + DCR (zero-config) | Share links |
| **Client support** | Custom A2A clients | Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc. | Browser |
| **Interaction** | Task-based | Tool-based | Chat-based |
| **Access control** | Access tokens (mode + scope) | Email-based ACL | Share links with optional password |
| **Session ownership** | Access token owner | Connector owner | Guest or share creator |
| **Use case** | Agent-to-agent delegation | AI tool calling our agent | Human chat with agent |

All three share the same underlying services: SessionService, MessageService, agent environments.

## Security Model

### Authentication Layers

1. **Email ACL** — Only connector owner or users in `allowed_emails` can complete OAuth
2. **PKCE** — Required for all clients; prevents authorization code interception
3. **Client credentials** — DCR-issued `client_id` + `client_secret` (secret stored as SHA256 hash)
4. **Opaque tokens** — Database-backed, immediately revocable
5. **Token audience validation** — TokenVerifier ensures tokens are connector-scoped (cross-connector isolation)
6. **Connector active check** — Deactivated connectors reject all requests

### Cascade Behavior

- **Connector deleted** → All OAuth clients, auth codes, tokens CASCADE-deleted
- **Connector deactivated** → MCP server evicted from registry; TokenVerifier rejects all tokens
- **Email removed from ACL** → Existing tokens remain valid until expiry; for immediate revocation, deactivate the connector

### Session Isolation

- Session routing is driven by `context_id`, not by `mcp_session_id` (transport session)
- `context_id` is cross-connector verified: session must belong to the requesting connector
- Each new chat (empty `context_id`) creates a new platform session
- No cross-session visibility between chats
- Mode enforcement: connector mode determines session mode

---

## Design Decisions

1. **Fixed tool set** — `send_message` rather than auto-generating tools from agent config. Keeps the MCP surface predictable. The agent decides which capabilities to invoke based on the message.

2. **`context_id` for per-chat isolation** — Claude Desktop (and similar clients) reuse a single MCP transport session across all chats, so `mcp_session_id` cannot distinguish conversations. Instead, `send_message` returns a `context_id` (the platform session UUID) that the LLM echoes back on subsequent calls. New chat = fresh LLM context = empty `context_id` = new session. The `mcp_session_id` is stored as metadata but never used for session lookup.

3. **Opaque tokens, not JWTs** — Database lookup on each request enables immediate revocation. We already hit the DB for connector validation, so token lookup adds minimal overhead.

4. **One MCPServer per connector** — Required because the SDK binds `resource_server_url` per instance. Also provides natural isolation and simplifies TokenVerifier.

5. **Shared OAuth AS** — Single set of OAuth endpoints for all connectors, using `resource` parameter (RFC 8707) to identify which connector. Avoids duplicating OAuth logic per connector.

6. **Email-based ACL over URL secrecy** — URLs leak easily. Email list gives explicit, auditable, revocable access control without changing the connector URL.

7. **Server-side OAuth request storage** — The consent page receives only an opaque nonce. All sensitive OAuth params stored server-side, preventing parameter tampering by the frontend.

8. **Sequential message processing** — Concurrent `send_message` calls on the same session are queued. Prevents race conditions in agent environment communication.

---

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Session management tools: `list_sessions`, `get_session_status`
- External OAuth providers (Auth0/Keycloak) — swap AS, keep TokenVerifier
- Per-connector rate limiting and usage tracking
