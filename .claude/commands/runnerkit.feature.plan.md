description: Create comprehensive architectural implementation plan for a new feature in the workflow-runner-core project.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). This is the feature description that you'll create an implementation plan for.

## Context

You are working with a **Full Stack FastAPI + React application** (workflow-runner-core). Feature implementation plans are comprehensive architectural documents that describe HOW to implement features.

### Document Organization
- **Location**: `docs/agent-sessions/` (or appropriate location based on feature domain)
- **Format**: Single markdown file with complete implementation architecture
- **Naming**: `[feature-name-kebab-case].md` or `[feature-name-kebab-case]_implementation.md`
- **Purpose**: Blueprint for developers/LLMs to implement the feature step-by-step

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, you must:
1. **Have a clear feature description** from user input
2. **Understand the feature scope** - what's included in MVP vs future enhancements

## Required Documentation Reading

Before creating the implementation plan, you MUST read the following documentation files to understand the existing architecture:

### Always Read (Core Architecture)
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project overview, technology stack, development patterns
2. **`docs/agent-sessions/business_logic.md`** - Core business logic and architecture patterns

### Conditionally Read (Based on Feature Requirements)

Read these files ONLY if the feature touches these domains:

- **`docs/user_workspaces_management.md`** - If feature involves workspaces or multi-tenancy
- **`docs/agent-sessions/agent_env_credentials_management.md`** - If feature involves sensitive data or encryption
- **`docs/agent-sessions/agent_solutions_knowledge_tool.md`** - If feature involves agent tools or MCP servers
- **`docs/agent-sessions/agent_solutions_knowledge_management.md`** - Example of excellent feature documentation
- Any other relevant documentation based on the feature domain

**Important**: Only read conditionally required docs if they're relevant. Don't waste tokens on unrelated documentation.

## Execution Flow

The text the user typed after the command in the triggering message **is** the feature description.

Given that feature description, follow these steps:

### 1. Understand the Feature Request

a. **Parse user description** from User Input:
   - If empty or unclear: Ask for clarification with specific questions
   - Extract key requirements, constraints, and desired behavior
   - Identify which existing systems this feature touches

b. **Generate feature name** (kebab-case):
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-5 word kebab-case name that captures the essence
   - Examples:
     - "Notification system for agent events" → "agent-event-notifications"
     - "User workspace billing integration" → "workspace-billing-integration"
     - "Real-time agent logs streaming" → "agent-logs-streaming"

c. **Determine scope**:
   - What's included in the initial implementation (MVP)?
   - What should be excluded for future enhancements?
   - Are there any technology preferences or constraints?

### 2. Read Required Documentation

a. **Always read**:
   - `CLAUDE.md` - For project structure and patterns
   - `docs/agent-sessions/business_logic.md` - For architecture patterns

b. **Conditionally read** based on feature requirements:
   - Workspace-related docs if feature involves multi-tenancy
   - Credentials/encryption docs if feature handles sensitive data
   - Agent tool docs if feature extends agent capabilities
   - Any other relevant documentation

c. **Extract patterns**:
   - Note existing approaches you should follow
   - Identify similar features to reference
   - Understand security patterns (encryption, access control)
   - Note database patterns (UUID keys, foreign keys, cascade behavior)
   - Understand API patterns (dependency injection, error handling)

### 3. Set Output Path

a. **Determine output location**:
   ```
   OUTPUT_PATH = docs/agent-sessions/[feature-name].md
   ```
   Or another appropriate location based on the feature domain

b. **Check for existing plan**:
   - If file already exists, you're updating an existing plan
   - If not, you're creating a new plan

### 4. Design the Architecture

Now create the comprehensive implementation plan. This is a **technical architecture document**, NOT business requirements.

a. **Think like a software architect**:
   - Focus on HOW to implement, not WHAT or WHY
   - Design data models, API endpoints, services, UI components
   - Consider security, performance, extensibility
   - Reference existing patterns from the codebase
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases

b. **Look for similar existing features** (if relevant):
   - Check `docs/agent-sessions/` for related feature documentation
   - Identify patterns to follow for consistency
   - Don't automatically read other docs - ask user if they want integration analysis

c. **Make architectural decisions**:
   - Make informed decisions based on FastAPI + React best practices
   - Follow existing patterns from the codebase (from CLAUDE.md and business_logic.md)
   - Document any assumptions made

### 5. Write the Architectural Plan

Write a comprehensive markdown document to `OUTPUT_PATH` that includes ALL of the following sections:

#### Required Sections in the Document

1. **Overview** (2-3 sentences):
   - Brief summary of the feature
   - Core capabilities (bullet points)
   - High-level flow diagram (ASCII or mermaid)

2. **Architecture Overview**:
   - System components diagram
   - Data flow illustration
   - Integration points with existing systems

3. **Data Models**:
   For each new database table, specify:
   - Table name and purpose
   - All fields with types, constraints, defaults
   - Relationships (foreign keys, cascade behavior: CASCADE, SET NULL, etc.)
   - Indexes for performance (specify which columns)
   - Security considerations (encryption fields, access control rules)
   - Lifecycle states if applicable (e.g., pending → active → error)

4. **Security Architecture**:
   - Encryption approach (reference existing `backend/app/core/security.py` patterns)
   - Access control rules (ownership-based, permission-based, admin access)
   - Input validation and sanitization requirements
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Sensitive data handling (what gets logged, what gets exposed in APIs)

5. **Backend Implementation**:

   **API Routes**:
   - Endpoint paths and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Request/response schemas (describe field names and types)
   - Dependencies (SessionDep, CurrentUser, admin guards)
   - Authorization checks (who can access what)
   - Background task triggers (if any)

   **Service Layer**:
   - Service class names and file locations (e.g., `backend/app/services/notification_service.py`)
   - Key methods with signatures and descriptions
   - Business logic encapsulation
   - Integration with existing services
   - Error handling patterns

   **Background Tasks** (if needed):
   - Task descriptions
   - Trigger mechanisms
   - Idempotency considerations
   - Error recovery strategies

6. **Frontend Implementation**:

   **UI Components**:
   - Page locations and routes (e.g., `frontend/src/routes/_layout/notifications.tsx`)
   - Component structure and hierarchy
   - Form fields and validation rules
   - Modal dialogs and interactions
   - Reference similar existing components (e.g., "similar to Settings page")

   **State Management**:
   - React Query usage (query keys, mutations, cache invalidation)
   - Context providers if needed
   - localStorage or sessionStorage usage

   **User Flows**:
   - Step-by-step interaction descriptions
   - Empty states and loading states
   - Error states and user feedback
   - Success confirmations

7. **Database Migrations**:
   - Migration file naming convention (e.g., `add_notifications_table.py`)
   - Tables to create/modify
   - Indexes to add (specify columns and type: btree, unique, etc.)
   - Foreign key constraints (specify ON DELETE behavior)
   - Downgrade strategy (how to rollback)

8. **Knowledge Repository Format** (if applicable):
   - File structure requirements
   - Configuration file schemas
   - Validation rules

9. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**:
   - Common failure scenarios
   - Error messages and recovery flows
   - Validation failures (what to check)
   - Network/API failures
   - Data integrity issues
   - User permission issues

10. **UI/UX Considerations**:
    - Status indicators and color schemes
    - User guidance (tooltips, help text, empty states)
    - Copy-to-clipboard features (if applicable)
    - Onboarding flows (if needed)
    - Accessibility considerations

11. **Integration Points**:
    - How feature connects to existing systems
    - API client regeneration steps (remind about `scripts/generate-client.sh`)
    - Agent-env tool extensions (if applicable)
    - Workspace integration (if applicable)

12. **Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)**:
    - Features intentionally excluded from initial implementation
    - Extensibility points for future work

13. **Summary Checklist**:
    Organize as actionable tasks:
    - **Backend tasks**: Specific, actionable items (e.g., "Create notifications table with fields...", "Add API endpoint POST /api/v1/notifications")
    - **Frontend tasks**: Specific, actionable items (e.g., "Create NotificationBell component", "Add notification preferences to Settings page")
    - **Agent-env tasks**: If applicable (e.g., "Update agent-env to include notification_api_key")
    - **Testing & validation tasks**: What to test, not how (e.g., "Verify notifications are created when agent completes", "Test notification preferences save correctly")

### 6. Quality Validation

After writing the plan, validate it:

a. **Review against checklist**:

b. **Ensure references to existing code**:
   - References similar files in the codebase
   - Follows established patterns from CLAUDE.md
   - Integrates with existing authentication/encryption/services
   - Considers workspace permissions (if applicable)

c. **Check for completeness**:
   - Another developer could implement from this plan

### DON'T:
- ❌ Write actual code (only describe what code should do)
- ❌ Generate tests (only outline what should be tested)
- ❌ Include performance benchmarks (mention optimization strategies only)
- ❌ Skip security considerations
- ❌ Ignore existing patterns (always reuse established approaches)
- ❌ Create documentation for the feature itself (focus on implementation plan)

### Focus on Implementation, Not Business

This is a **technical architecture document**, NOT a business specification:

- Focus on **HOW** to implement, not WHAT or WHY
- Include technical details: data models, API endpoints, services, components
- Describe implementation approach, file locations, method signatures
- Reference existing code patterns and infrastructure
- Written for developers/LLMs who will implement the feature
- Think like a software architect, not a business analyst

### FastAPI + React Patterns

**Backend Patterns**:
- UUID primary keys for all tables
- SQLModel for database models (inherits from SQLModel base, `table=True`)
- Alembic for database migrations
- Dependency injection: SessionDep, CurrentUser
- Services in `backend/app/services/` for business logic
- CRUD operations follow established patterns
- Error handling with HTTPException
- Background tasks for async operations

**Frontend Patterns**:
- TanStack Router for file-based routing
- TanStack React Query for state management
- Protected routes use `_layout/` prefix
- Auto-generated API client from OpenAPI spec (never manually edit)
- Forms use react-hook-form + zod validation
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components for styling

**Security Patterns**:
- Encryption using Fernet (symmetric) via `backend/app/core/security.py`
- JWT authentication with CurrentUser dependency
- Workspace-based permissions (if applicable)
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest

**Database Patterns**:
- Foreign keys with CASCADE or SET NULL
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- created_at, updated_at timestamps
- Soft deletes with is_active/is_deleted flags (if applicable)

## Example Reference

For an example of excellent feature architecture documentation, see:
- `docs/agent-sessions/agent_solutions_knowledge_management.md`

This example shows the level of detail, structure, and completeness expected.

## Notes

- This command creates a **complete architectural implementation plan**
- The plan should be comprehensive enough for another developer/LLM to implement
- Focus on technical details, not business justification
- Always consider security, workspace permissions, and extensibility
- Reference existing patterns and infrastructure extensively
