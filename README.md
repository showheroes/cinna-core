# Cinna Core

> **Experimental** — This project is in an early experimental phase and under active development. APIs, data models, and features may change without notice. Use at your own risk. Not recommended for production workloads.

> **Tip:** This project is designed to be explored with AI coding assistants. Try prompts like `read core and explain me how agent credentials are working` to navigate the codebase and understand any feature in depth.
> If you're using an AI assistant other than Claude Code, make sure to include `CLAUDE.md` in the context — it contains the project conventions and navigation instructions.

**Open-source platform for building, running, and orchestrating AI agents.**

Create custom AI agents with their own prompts, credentials, and tools — each running in an isolated Docker environment. Chat with them, schedule them, connect them to email, expose them via APIs, or wire them into multi-agent teams.

## Why Cinna

Cinna gives you the full operational layer on top (not just SDK):

- **Isolated runtime per agent** — each agent runs in its own Docker container with a persistent workspace, so agents can create files, install packages, and maintain state across sessions
- **Two-mode architecture** — build your agent interactively (building mode with full context), then switch to a lightweight conversation mode for production use at lower cost
- **Multi-SDK support** — use Claude Code (with Anthropic) or OpenCode (with OpenAI, Google, and many other providers). Switch between them without changing your agent
- **No vendor lock-in** — self-hosted, GPL-3.0 licensed, runs anywhere Docker runs

## Key Features

### Agent Management
- Create agents with custom system prompts, credentials, and SDK configuration
- Multiple environment templates (general, Python-advanced, custom Dockerfiles)
- Blue-green deployments — switch between environments instantly for rollback
- Plugin marketplace for extending agent capabilities

### Chat & Sessions
- Persistent chat sessions with streaming responses
- File upload/download within agent workspace
- Slash commands (`/files`, `/rebuild-env`, `/session-reset`)
- Markdown rendering with tool call visualization

### Automation & Triggers
- CRON-based scheduling with natural language input
- Email-to-agent automation (IMAP/SMTP integration)
- Webhook triggers for external system integration
- Agent-to-agent handover for task delegation

### Interoperability
- **A2A Protocol** — expose agents as Agent-to-Agent services for cross-platform communication
- **MCP Server** — make any agent available as a tool server for external LLM clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- **MCP Connectors** — connect agents to external MCP servers for additional tools

### Knowledge & RAG
- Git-based knowledge sources with automatic article indexing
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Public/private knowledge scoping

### Collaboration
- Clone-based agent sharing between users
- Guest access via shareable links (no account required)
- Agent webapps — lightweight dashboards served from agent workspace
- Customizable monitoring dashboards with per-agent blocks

### Agentic Teams
- Visual org-chart builder for multi-agent orchestration
- Directed connections with handover prompts
- Team-scoped task management with short-code IDs

### Developer Experience
- CLI tool ([cinna-cli](https://github.com/opencinna/cinna-cli)) for local agent development
- Workspace sync, Docker build context, credential pull
- MCP knowledge proxy for AI coding tools

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, SQLModel ORM, Alembic migrations |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencinna/cinna-core.git
cd cinna-core
make install
```

The install wizard will walk you through configuring admin credentials, database settings, and security keys. It copies `.env.example`, applies your values, builds Docker images, runs migrations, and seeds the admin user — everything needed to go from clone to running instance.

Open http://localhost:5173 and log in with the admin credentials you chose during setup.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full development setup, workflow, and Makefile reference.
