"""The reachability verdict — why a decision went the way it did, in words.

Plan §9's headline output: an agent the classifier never saw cannot be
explained by the candidate table, because the candidate table has no row for
it. So the verdict says it out loud, to the admin staring at a ``no_match``:

    This user has 3 eligible candidates; Equation Assistant is not among them
    because it has neither a router trigger prompt nor example prompts — set
    one on its Configuration tab.

**That sentence used to be an App MCP sentence**, and a different one: *"it is
not a bundle install and has no App MCP route — add one from its Integrations
tab"*. It was emitted for every origin, Google Chat included, which made this
module the place the surface divergence was baked in — it instructed a channel
user to configure an *MCP exposure* to fix a *channel* problem
(``docs/application/routing_tuning/routing_tuning.md`` — *the verdict is split
by origin for wording, never for findings*). The scope split
answered that by giving the channel origins their own half. The
``AppAgentRoute`` deletion then removed the other half's subject entirely: App
MCP builds its ballot from the same two candidate providers a channel does, so
there is no route, assignment or ``channel_app_mcp`` flag left for any verdict
to name.

What survives of that split is :data:`_ORIGIN_PROFILES` and the
:class:`_RemedyProfile` threaded through everything below — now carrying
**wording**, not findings. Every surface reaches the same conclusions by the
same tests; they differ in what they call the thing the reader routes over, and
in what Pass 2 means (a channel has one, App MCP does not). **The split is by
origin, never by candidate kind.** That distinction is worth keeping stated,
because gating on ``kind == KIND_AGENT`` looks equivalent and is not:
``SKIP_ALREADY_INSTALLED``, ``SKIP_NOT_INSTALLABLE`` and ``SKIP_NO_REVISION``
are recorded by Pass 2's auto-install scan as ``KIND_BUNDLE``, Pass 2 runs on
channel decisions, and ``SKIP_ALREADY_INSTALLED``'s remedy used to read
*"Check the installed agent's App MCP route"* — a live §2.4 defect that a
``kind`` gate would have walked straight past. ``kind`` is consulted in exactly
one place (:data:`_CHANNEL_AGENT_SKIP_EXPLANATIONS`) and only to tell two
*facts* apart, never to decide which surface the reader is on.

The line the split is drawn along:

- **What to change *now* follows the origin.** Every verdict derived from
  current configuration, every remedy, and every count noun that names what the
  candidates *are*, is written for the surface the decision ran on.
- **What the router *did* stays as recorded.** An explanation clause
  paraphrases a ``skip_reason`` the recorder wrote during that decision; it
  describes history, and history does not change with the surface reading it.
  An **action clause is always forward-looking**, so it must match the surface
  the reader is on even when the explanation beside it does not — which is why
  ``SKIP_ROUTE_INACTIVE`` on a channel trace still says the route was off (true,
  and the reason it was skipped) and no longer says to switch it back on (which
  would change nothing on a channel today).

**Why the sentence is built here and not in the card** (plan §10, Phase 4).
Three reasons, and the third is the one that matters:

1. It is testable. Every branch below has a test asserting the sentence it
   emits; wording that lives in TSX has nothing that fails when it goes wrong.
2. It lives with the rules it paraphrases. The clause "it has neither a router
   trigger prompt nor example prompts" is a restatement of the candidate
   providers' own eligibility test, and :func:`_has_router_wording` **calls**
   that test rather than restating it (see its docstring). Two files apart,
   they drift; one import apart, the drift is visible. The clause this
   paragraph used to defend — "it is not a bundle install and has no App MCP
   route", justified by being one import from
   ``AppAgentRouteService._create_auto_route_for_agent`` — outlived that
   import by a commit and then outlived the whole service. A rationale that
   cites a symbol is only as true as the symbol.
3. A wrong diagnosis is worse than none. This surface tells an admin what to
   change on somebody else's agent. A sentence assembled from whichever fields
   the card happened to have would be confidently wrong on the branches nobody
   thought about, and it would look exactly like the branches that are right.

**Two sources of truth, deliberately, in this order.** A trace records what the
router actually considered; the database records what is configured *now*. The
trace wins whenever it has an answer, because it describes the decision being
diagnosed — the route may well have been fixed since. The database is consulted
only where the trace has no answer, which is precisely the case the trace cannot
explain: it has no row for something that was never a candidate.

There are two such places, and the second was added by channel policy. The
first is an **expected agent the trace never mentions**
(:func:`_verdict_from_configuration` and its channel half). The second is **why
Pass 2 never ran** (:func:`_channel_pass_2_block`) — the router does record
that, but into ``StageTrace.reason``, which the message-text gate withholds, so
the trace's answer is unavailable on exactly the servers that need it most. Both
therefore describe **configuration as it stands now**, not as it stood at
decision time. That is deliberate for a surface whose question is "what do I
change to fix this", and it is said out loud in the sentences themselves rather
than left for a reader to infer.

**What this reads about the expected agent is an allowlist**, and the split
added to it deliberately rather than by drift. Two fields are *quoted*: the
agent's name and its owner's email. Two more are read for their **emptiness
only** — ``router_trigger_prompt`` and ``example_prompts``, in
:func:`_has_router_wording` — so what reaches the response is one bit ("set" or
"not set"), never the wording itself. All four clear the bar §7 sets for
``candidates[].trigger_prompt``: owner-authored configuration, not
sender-derived, already visible to this (superuser-only) audience — and the
trace surface already serves the *full text* of both, so a presence bit adds
nothing a reader of this page could not already see. Nothing else about the
agent reaches the response, and a fifth field would have to clear the same bar
when it is added rather than inherit these four's answer.

**Near-miss ranking reuses the shared Jaccard helpers by calling them**
(plan §3: "Reuse verbatim"). They live in
``app/services/routing/text_similarity.py`` —
``tokens_for_similarity`` / ``jaccard_similarity`` — alongside this module
rather than on the service that first happened to need them. A second copy of
the tokenizer would make "closest: X 0.31" and install-time conflict detection
disagree about what a token is, silently, the first time either was tuned; the
module is imported and its functions called through it, so a test can patch the
definition site and prove no copy crept in.

**Never break the thing it observes** (§11a Rule 2). This module runs on the
read path only — no capture is open, no routing decision is in flight — so a
failure here costs a diagnosis, not a delivery. :meth:`diagnose` is still
total, because its caller is ``RoutingTraceService.get``, which serves the
whole trace: a diagnosis that raised would take the trace detail with it, and
the trace is the more valuable half.

See ``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §2, §9 and §10 Phase 4, and
``docs/application/routing_tuning/routing_tuning.md`` /
``docs/application/routing_tuning/routing_tuning_tech.md`` for the verdict's
origin split and the remedy profiles it feeds.

# ── Verdict codes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# One code per sentence *per origin*, and that pairing is load-bearing: a test
# pins the code *and* the sentence, so a reworded verdict that no longer answers
# its branch fails rather than passing under a code that still looks right.
# Plain strings, matching the feature's convention — readers tolerate unknown
# values.
#
# **A code names a finding, not a wording.** Where a channel and an App MCP
# decision reach the same finding by the same test — this user had no
# candidates; this agent is not the sender's; it looks reachable now — they
# share the code and differ only in the sentence, because a client grouping or
# colouring by code is answering "what kind of problem is this", which is the
# same answer on both surfaces. (``frontend/.../routingCopy.ts`` tones every
# ``expected_agent_*`` code by prefix, so a new one needs no client change.) A
# code is added only for a finding with no counterpart on the other surface,
# which today is **four**, in two pairs, each marked "channel origins only"
# where it is declared: the ``no_candidates`` split by why Pass 2 never ran,
# and the ``expected_agent_*`` pair further down.
#
# **A code may carry more than one sentence**, and two of them now do. The rule
# is the one above restated: the code names the finding, so a second sentence
# is right exactly when the finding is unchanged and only the *remedy's
# subject* moves — and a remedy is the half that must never be wrong.
#
# - ``CODE_ROUTED`` reads differently when the decision matched on a pin,
#   because there the generic remedy (tighten the winner's trigger prompt) is
#   inert: no classifier ran. Unlike the ``expected_agent_*`` family,
#   ``"routed"`` is toned by the client *by name*, so a new code beside it
#   would render a success as an unrecognised value.
# - ``CODE_NO_CANDIDATES_CHANNEL_SCOPE`` reads differently depending on whether
#   the restricting scope is the sender's own or the channel's admin default,
#   because ``agent_scope`` is inheritable and the two live on different
#   people's screens. Same finding, two owners.
#
# See ``_general_verdict``.

#: Channel origins only, and the two of them are :data:`CODE_NO_CANDIDATES`

#: to the auto-install list", which is a remedy that names a control that would
#: not change the outcome when the sender's channel policy bars the catalog
#: pass — the one thing this module treats as worse than a coarse answer.
#:
#: Their finding genuinely has no App MCP counterpart: channel policy is not
#: read on that surface at all, so this is the second *pair* under the rule the
#: comment above states, not an exception to it.
#:
#: :data:`CODE_NO_CANDIDATES_CHANNEL_SCOPE` carries **two** sentences, split on
#: whether the restricting scope is the sender's own or the channel's admin
#: default. Same finding, different screen to go and fix it on. See
#: :data:`_PASS_2_BLOCK_SCOPE_USER`.
#:
#: **Both are computed from the policy as it stands NOW**, not as it stood when
#: the decision ran — see :func:`_channel_pass_2_block`, which is where that

#: comes from.
#:
#: **Client tone is handled.** ``frontend/.../routingCopy.ts``'s
#: ``diagnosisTone`` matches ``no_candidates`` codes by *prefix*
#: (``code.startsWith("no_candidates")``), so these two land in the same
#: ``warn`` arm as the base ``"no_candidates"`` without needing their own
#: entries — and a later ``no_candidates_*`` variant inherits the tone too. The

#: switch that no longer exists. Both surfaces now build their ballot from the

#
# Consulted narrowest-first, and *which* tables come first is a property of the
# remedy profile rather than of a boolean: the profile's agent-only overrides,
# then its overrides, then this one, which is the origin-neutral base every
# profile falls through to (see :class:`_RemedyProfile` and
# :func:`_skip_explanation`). The overrides are deliberately sparse rather than
# a parallel copy: an explanation restates what the recorder wrote during that
# decision, and history reads the same on every surface. Only where a *remedy*
# would point at the wrong control, or where the same ``skip_reason`` names two
# different missing things, does an entry appear.
#
# A profile with no override tables — App MCP, generic, identity — reads this
# base table alone, which is exactly the lookup the two-arm version made for
# everything that was not a channel.

    #
    # The skip **row** is genuinely produced, and has been since phase 3.
    # Whenever an identity owner has named this caller on a binding whose

    # :func:`_verdict_from_trace`, reached when :func:`_find_candidate`

    # parameter used to be annotated ``uuid.UUID`` on both
    # :meth:`RoutingReachabilityService.diagnose` and the route behind it
    # (``admin_routing.get_routing_trace``), while an identity candidate
    # always writes the namespaced ``identity:{owner_id}`` — and the
    # annotation was the whole obstacle, because a UUID cannot name a
    # person. Phase 6 of the channels & identity unification widened it to
    # ``str``, so the surface can finally ask "why was this *person* not
    # reachable".
    #
    # Coverage, stated exactly because this file treats an unverifiable
    # claim about it as a defect. The **channel override below** is pinned
    # by ``tests/api/routing/routing_reachability_verdict_test.py``'s
    # ``test_verdict_for_an_identity_owner_who_shared_nothing_reachable``,

#: The ``channel`` profile's overrides — :data:`_PROFILE_CHANNEL`'s
#: ``skip_overrides``, shared by :data:`_PROFILE_EMAIL`, and **gated on the
#: profile alone**, never on the candidate's ``kind``. Every entry here is a
#: reason a channel decision can actually record, whose base remedy above sends
#: the reader to an App MCP control that a channel does not read.
#:
#: All three are reachable on a channel and none of them is ``KIND_AGENT``-only,
#: which is why this table is keyed by origin and not by kind:
#:
#: - ``SKIP_ALREADY_INSTALLED`` — recorded by Pass 2's auto-install scan as a
#:   ``KIND_BUNDLE`` candidate (``channel_routing_service._route_catalog``), on
#:   channel decisions, today. Its base remedy is the §2.4 defect verbatim.
#: - ``SKIP_AGENT_MISSING`` — recorded by channel Pass 1 when the winning
#:   candidate's row is gone by the time it is loaded. There is no route in that
#:   story at all any more: the candidate came from ``WHERE owner_id = sender``.
#: - ``SKIP_ROUTE_INACTIVE`` — no longer producible **anywhere**: its producer
#:   was ``AppAgentRouteService``, which is deleted along with the routes it
#:   filtered. Traces captured before that carry it and are still read, so the
#:   explanation stays: it is what happened. The action cannot, because there is
#:   no route left to switch back on, on either surface.
#: ``SKIP_IDENTITY_UNAVAILABLE`` is the fourth, and it arrived exactly as this
#: comment predicted it would. It used to say "no entry here, and that is
#: correct today" because only App MCP Stage 1 recorded the reason; Phase 3 of
#: the channels & identity unification put ``IdentityCandidateProvider`` on the
#: channel ballot, so a channel decision can now carry it, and the base entry —
#: written in App MCP's voice — would send a channel user to an MCP card. The
#: entry below landed in the same change, per this file's convention: adding the
#: reason to a surface and adding its override for that surface are one change.
#:
#: What that entry did **not** do until phase 6 was reach a reader, and this

#
# **The origin picks the remedies, and nothing else.** Which branch fires and
# which code comes back is identical on every surface — since the
# ``AppAgentRoute`` deletion they all route over the same two candidate
# providers, so they reach the same findings by the same tests. What still
# differs is *wording*: the noun for the thing the reader routes over, whether
# there is a Pass 2 and a channel policy to name at all, and which skip-reason
# remedies point at a control this surface actually has.
#
# **This used to be a boolean, and a boolean has a far end.**
# ``_is_channel_origin`` sorted every origin into channel-or-not, so everything
# that was not a channel got the App MCP wording — including every origin the
# set had never heard of. The comment here argued that was the safe end,
# because App MCP's wording is the *narrower* of the two: it promises no Pass 2
# and no channel policy, so it describes only machinery every surface has.
#
# **That argument is wrong, and the counter-example is already in this file.**
# See :data:`_CHANNEL_SKIP_EXPLANATIONS`'s comment on
# ``SKIP_IDENTITY_UNAVAILABLE``: its base entry, written in App MCP's voice,
# "would send a channel user to an MCP card", and stopping it took a
# hand-written Phase 3 override. Narrow is not neutral. A narrower surface's
# wording is still *one surface's* wording, and handed to a reader on another
# surface it names controls they do not have — which is the §2.4 defect, not a
# safe degradation of it. The two-arm model failed at its default on an origin
# the set *did* know about; an origin it does not know has nobody to notice and
# write an override for it.
#
# So an unknown origin now degrades to :data:`_PROFILE_GENERIC`, which claims
# no machinery beyond what every surface has and names no control that might
# not be there: where the App MCP arm said "App MCP routes over the caller's
# own agents" it says "this surface". Coarser, and true of a surface that does
# not exist yet — which is exactly what an unknown origin is.
#
# **A profile is data, not a branch.** Adding a surface is a row in
# :data:`_ORIGIN_PROFILES`; forgetting one costs a generic verdict rather than
# a confidently wrong one, and the profile is resolved **once** per diagnosis
# and threaded down (see :func:`_diagnose`).

    - ``surface`` — the noun in :func:`_verdict_from_configuration`'s
      foreign-owner clause, the one sentence that still says out loud what the

    - ``reads_channel_policy`` — whether this surface has a Pass 2 and a

      loses two verdict codes outright and is never told that the channel's own

    **Exactly one branch below is written twice**, and it is written twice
    because of what the surface *has*, not what it is called: ``no_candidates``
    asks :func:`_channel_pass_2_block` only under a profile that reads channel
    policy, because the base sentence's remedy ("…or add its bundle to the
    auto-install list") names a pass a surface without one never runs. The
    other two negative branches — everything skipped, and nothing matched —
    are origin-neutral as written and are served to every profile unchanged.

    A pinned decision splits twice more, and **not by origin**: once under
    ``routed``, because the generic remedy (tighten the winner's trigger
    prompt) is inert against a pin, and once below the terminal-verdict
    branches, because a pin that *failed* would otherwise be diagnosed as a
    candidate scan whose winner was rejected — a scan that never happened.
    Both are splits by ``match_method``, which is a fact about what the router
    did rather than about which surface it ran on, so neither needs a
    per-profile counterpart: only a channel pipeline records ``pinned`` at all.

    A quoted-reply decision splits the same two ways, for the same reasons.
    Under ``routed``, when the selected agent is the quoted one, no classifier
    chose it. Below the terminal-verdict branches, when Pass 1's re-load found
    the quoted agent gone or no longer the sender's, no classifier ran, and the
    generic candidate verdicts would prescribe trigger-prompt changes that could
    not have mattered. Only a channel pipeline records ``quoted_reply`` either.

    ``db`` is here for exactly one branch — the ``no_candidates`` one, and only
    under a profile that reads channel policy, where it asks
    :func:`_channel_pass_2_block` whether this sender's channel policy is what
    kept Pass 2 from running. The lookup is made **inside** that
    branch rather than up front deliberately: it is two to five ``SELECT``s
    depending on the channel's shape, this function runs on every trace read,
    and every other branch has its answer already.

    **One function for both origins**, and that is the shape of the fix. This
    used to be two: a channel half asking the three questions below, and an App
    MCP half asking four more about routes, assignments and the
    ``channel_app_mcp`` flag before it reached ownership at all. Every one of
    those four is about a switch that no longer exists — App MCP builds its
    ballot from ``ChannelCandidateProvider`` + ``IdentityCandidateProvider``,
    exactly as a channel does — so the two halves collapsed into the same three
    branches against the same two facts that make an agent a candidate:
    **who owns it**, and **whether its owner wrote anything for the classifier
    to match on**.

    ``profile`` therefore no longer picks the *findings*. It names the surface
    in one clause — ``profile.surface`` — and that is all it is still for here,
    which is why an origin nobody mapped can say "this surface" and still be
    right. Written as one
    function rather than two near-identical ones deliberately — two copies of a
    branch table drift, and this module's whole contract is that a verdict is
    never confidently wrong.

    Reads ``Agent`` and nothing else, so this function cannot drift back into
    prescribing a route: there is nothing here to prescribe one *from*, and no
    ``db`` to prescribe it with.

    **There is a third fact, and it is deliberately not asked here.** An agent
    the sender owns and has written wording for can still be excluded because
    it is not in the channel's ``agent_scope``. That exclusion is answered
    where it is recorded — the candidate provider writes a
    ``SKIP_NOT_IN_CHANNEL_SCOPE`` row, so :func:`_verdict_from_trace` handles
    it and control never arrives here. Asking again from configuration would
    mean loading the channel and re-resolving the policy on a read path whose
    contract is "reads ``Agent`` and nothing else", to answer a case that
    already has a better answer from the trace.
    What that leaves imprecise is the last branch below, for an agent the
    decision genuinely never saw: if it is out of scope *now*, "the re-run will
    show it as a candidate" overstates — the re-run will show it as a skip,
    with the right reason on it. A reader who follows the instruction gets the
    correct diagnosis one step later, which is the acceptable failure of the
    two available here.

    **A fourth fact is out of reach rather than skipped:** an agent somebody
    else owns can be reachable through an identity contact on either surface.
    The foreign-owner branch cannot say so, because saying so would mean
    enumerating whose identities name this sender — which is the enumeration
    the identity provider's own trace inversion exists to refuse.

    **When this is reached at all**, which is narrower than it looks. The
    candidate provider records *every* agent the sender owns — eligible ones as

    :data:`_PASS_2_BLOCK_SCOPE_DEFAULT`, :data:`_PASS_2_BLOCK_AUTO_INSTALL`, or
    ``None`` for "nothing in the channel's policy bars the catalog pass, or the
    policy cannot be resolved at all".

    ``ChannelPolicyService.describe`` rather than ``.resolve``, for one field:
    ``agent_scope_inherited``. ``agent_scope`` is inheritable, so a restricted
    scope is the admin's default about as often as it is the sender's own
    choice, and a remedy naming the wrong screen is the confidently-wrong
    diagnosis this module exists to refuse. ``describe`` computes that bit
    already and ``resolve`` throws it away, so this costs nothing beyond the
    call.

    ``allow_auto_install`` needs no such split: it is a column on
    ``ServerChannel`` with no per-user override at all, so there is only ever
    one screen to name.

    **The fact comes from the resolved policy, not from the trace.**
    ``ChannelRoutingService._record_pass_2_not_run`` writes a perfectly good
    note saying exactly this, into ``StageTrace.reason`` — and ``reason`` is
    deliberately absent from ``routing_trace.SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS``, so with
    ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` off the note never reaches the
    projection this module reads. A verdict that depended on it would be
    correct on some servers and silently generic on others, which is the worst
    of the three available behaviours. Giving ``StageTrace`` an allowlisted,
    server-authored "this pass did not run" code is the right structural fix
    and it is Phase 6's; until then this re-reads the source.

    **What that costs, stated rather than assumed.** A verdict is computed when
    somebody *reads* a trace, which can be long after the decision. Re-resolving
    the policy here therefore describes the configuration **as it stands now**,
    not as it stood at decision time — so a channel whose auto-install was on
    when the message arrived and has since been switched off is diagnosed as
    "switched off", and a Pass 2 that genuinely ran and found nothing is
    reported as a Pass 2 that could not run.

    That is judged correct for a *diagnosis*: this verdict's job is "what do I
    change to fix this", and the answer to that question is about today's
    configuration, not about a state nobody can act on any more. It is not
    left as a silent assumption — the sentences themselves say "as this
    channel's settings stand right now", and both actions carry
    :data:`READ_TIME_POLICY_CAVEAT`. The reader is told which clock they are
    reading.

    **Four ways the policy cannot be resolved, all answered ``None``** (the
    base sentence, i.e. the behaviour before this branch existed):

    - ``channel_id is None`` — a hand-typed ``POST /admin/routing/simulate``
      that named no channel. There is no ``ServerChannel`` row to resolve
      against, and that run really did decide under
      ``ResolvedChannelPolicy.for_no_channel`` — whose ``allow_auto_install``
      is ``True`` and whose scope is ``"all"`` — so the base sentence's
      auto-install remedy is *true* for it. This branch is checked first, and
      it is why nothing here defaults to a permissive policy of its own
      invention; see that classmethod's docstring on why a default would be a
      second, silently permissive policy source.
    - ``user_id is None`` — the sender's account was deleted
      (``RoutingDecision.user_id`` is ``SET NULL``). A policy is a fact about a
      person and a channel; with no person there is nothing to resolve.
    - The channel row is gone. ``RoutingDecision.channel_id`` is
      ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so this is near-unreachable — the trace would have
      gone with it — but a read path does not get to assume that.
    - The resolution raised. Caught here rather than left to
      :meth:`RoutingReachabilityService.diagnose`'s catch-all, which would cost
      the whole diagnosis (the candidate table and its skip reasons included)
      to lose one clause of one sentence. Degrading to the base sentence is the
      pre-existing behaviour, which is coarse but never wrong.

    Scope is checked **before** ``allow_auto_install``, and the order is the
    diagnosis. Both bar Pass 2 identically, so either sentence would be true
    when both are set — but a restricted scope also invalidates the *other*
    verdict's remedy, because under it giving this sender a new agent with a
    trigger prompt does not make them routable either. Reporting the
    auto-install switch first would send the reader to fix one thing and come
    back to a channel that still routes nothing. Same order, same reason, as
    ``ChannelRoutingService._record_pass_2_not_run``'s note vocabulary.

    A pin is **not** an answer here, and the reason is the one seam in an
    otherwise read-time argument, so it is stated rather than glossed. A
    *pinned decision* never reaches this branch — it is settled above by
    :func:`_general_verdict`'s ``MATCH_PINNED`` branch, and it leaves a
    candidate row behind besides, so ``not candidates`` is false for it. But
    that is a fact about the decision, and this function is otherwise about
    *now*: a pin set **since** the decision is a read-time state with no answer
    here, and the verdict will tell an admin to widen a scope on a channel that
    would today route by pin. Accepted, because the pin is visible on the same
    settings screen both remedies already send the reader to, and because
    inventing a fourth sentence for it would describe a decision nobody is
    looking at.
