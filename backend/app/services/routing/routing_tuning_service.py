"""Simulate, replay and recommendation-drafting for the admin tuning surface.

The read/write half of routing observability lives in ``routing_trace_service``;
this module is the *interactive* half — the three operations that make a stored
decision something an admin can poke at rather than only read.

Three properties hold this together, and each is load-bearing:

**Simulate has no side effects, structurally.** It calls
:meth:`ChannelRoutingService.decide` and stops. ``decide`` creates no thread
binding, no session, no install and sends no reply — not because a flag
suppresses those, but because nothing reachable from it can do them (see that
module's docstring). There is no ``simulate=True`` parameter anywhere in this
feature, deliberately: a flag makes the safety property something somebody has
to keep true at every branch forever, and this way it is a property of the call
graph.

**A simulate response exposes exactly what a stored trace exposes.** Not
"the same fields" — the *same function*. :meth:`simulate` persists the decision
and then returns ``RoutingTraceService.get(db, trace_id)``, which is literally
what ``GET /admin/routing/traces/{id}`` returns. So the message-text gate, the
``SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`` allowlist, the name resolution and the notices all apply
to a simulate by construction. A hand-rolled projection here would start
identical, drift on the next field added to one side, and the drift would be
silent — which is exactly the inventory failure the allowlist exists to prevent
one layer down. If this ever stops calling ``RoutingTraceService.get``, the
guarantee stops being a guarantee and becomes a comment.

**A simulate decides under the real channel policy.** Where the run names a
channel — always, on a replay of a channel trace — the sender's resolved policy
is read from the live row and handed to ``decide``, so the scope, the pin and
the auto-install gate are the ones the webhook would apply. Only a hand-typed
simulate with no channel gets the explicit no-channel policy. See
:meth:`RoutingTuningService._policy_for`; a permissive default there would make
this module's central claim — that it reproduces the real path — quietly false.

**Note what ``decide`` *does* write.** On its error path — and only there —
each routing pass persists its own ``outcome=error`` trace before re-raising,
because a trace the caller never receives is otherwise the one outcome no code
path can produce. That is the diagnostic, not an effect on the user's account,
and :meth:`simulate` accounts for it: it catches the re-raise and points the
admin at the row rather than swallowing the failure or returning a bare 500.

**Nothing here writes to another user's agent.** :meth:`recommend` generates
text and returns it. That is the feature's hard boundary (plan §1): when a
foreign agent routes badly the output is a copyable recommendation for its
owner, never an edit.

Access control, rate limiting and the audit row are the route's job, not this
module's — see ``app/api/routes/admin_routing.py``. What is *not* the route's
job is the reasoning about why they are required; that lives with the
``ROUTING_SIMULATE_RUN`` constant.

See ``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §6 and §12.

        every classifier call as context, and the quoted agent is preferred
        when it is on the target's ballot. They obey
        ``CHANNEL_QUOTE_ROUTING_ENABLED`` exactly as the real path does — with
        the switch off the webhook passes no quote, so neither does this, and
        the returned trace's quote fields are empty to show it.

        ``guidance_reply`` on the response is the guidance reply the sender
        would have been sent (``outcome="guided"``), composed from the decision
        by the same function the real path uses and never sent, with the named
        channel's markdown support (:meth:`_guidance_markdown`). It obeys
        ``CHANNEL_ROUTING_GUIDANCE_ENABLED`` like the webhook. It is the one
        field not read back from the stored row: the text is not stored.

        audit entry points at. It is also why the caller must refuse the run
        when ``ROUTING_TRACE_ENABLED`` is off — with no row there is nothing to
        read back, and inventing a response for that case would mean building
        the second projection this docstring exists to forbid.

        The channel policy is resolved **before** the run and from the real
        row, whenever a channel is named — see :meth:`_policy_for`. A simulate
        that routed over a different candidate set than the webhook would is

        **Resolved, never assumed.** Simulate and replay exist to reproduce the

        with: the sender's agent scope, their pinned agent, and whether the
        auto-install pass may run. A simulate that took a permissive default
        would show an admin a candidate set the webhook would never build, and
        the divergence would be invisible — the trace it returns looks exactly
        like a real one. This is the same reasoning that put
        ``include_catalog`` inside Pass 1 rather than only around Pass 2 (see
        ``ChannelRoutingService.decide``): a reproduction that quietly answers
        an easier question is worse than no reproduction.

        Three cases, and only the first is a policy this module invents:

        - **No channel named.** A hand-typed ``POST /admin/routing/simulate``
          has no ``ServerChannel`` to resolve against; that is the one case
          ``ResolvedChannelPolicy.for_no_channel`` exists for, and its
          docstring is the argument for why it is not spelled as a default.
        - **A channel that resolves.** The real policy, for this target user —
          the identical call the webhook makes.
        - **A channel id with no row behind it.** Reachable from **replay**,
          and there only as a race, and a narrow one: a replay's channel id
          comes off the stored trace row, ``RoutingDecision.channel_id`` is
          ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so a deleted channel takes its traces with it
          and ``replay_source`` would have 404'd on the row first. Degraded to
          the no-channel policy and logged, rather than raised: the run is a
          diagnostic, the sender's account and agents are still real, and
          refusing outright would turn a millisecond-wide race into an error an
          admin cannot act on.

          A **hand-typed simulate** id does not arrive here at all — the route
          404s on a ``channel_id`` that does not resolve, before anything is
          spent. That check is not a duplicate of this degrade: neither half of
          the paragraph above holds for an id nobody stored, and degrading one
          would mean classifying at real cost and then failing the trace INSERT
          on the foreign key.

          Note what the degrade does **not** buy, either here or there: it
          keeps the decision sane when the channel disappears mid-run, but the
          trace INSERT still names the vanished channel and still fails its
