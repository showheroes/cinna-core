"""In-process capture of a single routing decision.

Channel / App MCP / identity routing all make an LLM-mediated choice per
message, and until now the only trace of it was a one-line ``no_match`` in the
channel debug buffer plus INFO log spam. When an admin asks "why didn't it find
my agent", the answer needs the things no log line carries: which agents were
even *candidates*, which were dropped and why, what prompt the classifier saw,
which providers were tried, and what the model actually said.

``RoutingTrace`` is that record. It is a **span object over a ``ContextVar``**:

- A consumer opts in with ``RoutingTrace.capture(...)``. Everything recorded
  inside the ``with`` block lands on that trace.
- Every instrumentation point calls the module-level ``record_*`` helpers, which
  read :func:`current` and **no-op when there is no active capture**. That is
  what keeps this feature out of the routing signatures: an un-instrumented
  caller pays one ``ContextVar`` read.
- The recorder is **mutable and lock-guarded**. Channel routing runs its LLM
  call in a worker thread (``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``), which propagates a
  *copy* of the caller's context; because the ContextVar holds a mutable object,
  appends made inside the thread are visible through the caller's reference.
  Captures are nevertheless opened *inside* the thread target so the span's
  lifetime is unambiguous, and the target hands the trace back as a return value
  (see ``ChannelRoutingService._route_installed_in_thread``).

**The single highest-value rule:** ``candidates`` must include *excluded*
candidates carrying a ``skip_reason``. A trace listing only the finalists cannot
diagnose the failure mode that actually bites — the expected agent was never a
candidate at all.

**A pass that ran always leaves a stage.** ``capture()`` materialises its named
stage on entry, so "ran and found nothing" is distinguishable from "never ran"
*by construction* rather than by the coincidence of which code path happened to
reach a stage-creating mutator. The whole terminal-verdict vocabulary
(``record_outcome``, ``record_error``, ``finish``, ``note_match_method``) leaves
``stages`` untouched, so without the eager creation a short-circuiting pass —
e.g. ``_route_catalog`` returning early on an empty ``ServerAutoInstallBundle``
table, which is the *default state of a fresh deployment* — persisted with
``stages == []`` and read as though it had never executed.

**What survives ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT=False`` is an allowlist,
not a denylist.** ``SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`` (below the dataclasses) names the stage
fields that may be stored and served while the sender's text is gated off;
everything else — including any field added after this was written — is withheld
by default. Read the comment above that constant before adding a field to
``StageTrace``, ``CandidateTrace`` or ``LLMAttempt``: three rounds of enumerating
the tainted fields each missed one, which is why the polarity is inverted.

**Recording must never break routing.** Every entry point swallows its own
errors, exactly like ``ChannelDebugBuffer.record``. Note the same trap
documented there: the guard protects the *recording*, not the caller's argument
expressions, which Python evaluates first. Keep call-site arguments to
attributes you are certain exist — an ``AttributeError`` raised while building
an argument lands in the caller's broad ``except``, not in ours. The helpers
below therefore take whole objects and do their attribute reads *inside* the
guard wherever they can.

**Nothing here is persisted, and nothing here may import ``app.*``.** Durable
storage, retention and the admin read API live in ``routing_trace_service``,
which this module must never import — ``app/agents/`` imports *this* file, and
``app/agents/`` sits below ``app/services/``. That inversion is harmless only
while the imported module pulls in nothing but the standard library; a model or
settings dependency here closes the cycle. An architecture test enforces it.

ORIGIN_SERVER_CHANNEL = "server_channel"
#: LIVE as of phase 6 of the channels & identity unification, and the only
#: origin with a per-origin write setting: ``ROUTING_TRACE_APP_MCP_MODE``
#: (``off`` | ``metadata`` | ``full``, defaulting to ``metadata``). App MCP
#: routes *every* message rather than just thread openings and sits behind no
#: webhook rate limit, so it is the one origin whose write volume is unbounded.
#: ``AppMCPRoutingService.route_message`` opens the capture; that setting is
#: read in ``routing_trace_service`` and in the producer, never here — this
#: module imports nothing from ``app.*`` (see the module docstring), which is
#: also why the mode is applied to the trace rather than by it.
#:
#: The setting was **removed once**, when this constant was still reserved and
#: unreachable, on the ground that an operator setting it to ``off`` would have
#: believed they disabled a capture that was never running. It came back in the
#: same change that started emitting this origin, which was the condition its
#: removal note attached.
ORIGIN_APP_MCP = "app_mcp"
#: RESERVED — declared so the origin vocabulary is written down in one place,
#: not because anything emits it. Nothing opens a capture with this and no
#: trace has ever carried one: identity is a *stage*
#: (``STAGE_IDENTITY_STAGE2``) reached inside a ``server_channel`` or
#: ``app_mcp`` decision, never a decision of its own (settled decisions §2.10,
#: §2.15).
ORIGIN_IDENTITY = "identity"
#: LIVE as of phase 6 of the channels & identity unification. Email is a
#: ``ServerChannel`` like any other — it resolves a ``ResolvedChannelPolicy``,
#: runs Pass 1 and Pass 2, and reaches routing through
#: ``ChannelInboundService.process_inbound`` — so it is a transport label, not
#: a different kind of decision. That is also why the reachability verdict puts
#: it in the *channel* remedy profile: every switch a channel verdict names is
#: one an email channel really has.
#:
#: **This changed an existing surface's value.** Email decisions carried
#: ``server_channel`` until phase 6, because the polled path took ``decide``'s
#: default. Rows written before that still carry it, and nothing rewrites them
#: — so "every email trace" and "every ``origin="email"`` trace" are different
#: sets, and anything counting email traffic across that boundary has to say
#: which it means. ``google_chat`` deliberately keeps ``server_channel``:
#: renaming it would move a value the admin filter, the docs and three tests
#: already agree on, for no gain.
ORIGIN_EMAIL = "email"
#: LIVE as of Phase 3, and the first origin other than ``server_channel`` that
#: anything actually writes. ``POST /admin/routing/simulate`` and
#: ``.../traces/{id}/replay`` open their captures with this, and those rows are
#: the only ones carrying ``actor_user_id`` (the admin who ran it) — the real
#: path leaves it NULL.
#:
#: **Readers must not assume a single origin.** The list route's ``origin``
#: filter is a free-form string and always was, ``_NameResolver`` handles the
#: NULL ``channel_id`` a simulate row carries, and the retention purge is
#: origin-blind — so a simulate row expires on the same window as a real one,
#: which is the intended behaviour and not an oversight. What a simulate row is
#: *not* is evidence that a message was ever sent: it is an admin's what-if.
#: Anything that counts traffic, or reads the table as a record of what senders
#: did, has to filter the real-traffic origins explicitly — which since phase 6
#: means ``server_channel`` **and** ``email``, not ``server_channel`` alone. A
#: filter written when there was one real origin now silently undercounts, which
#: is the cost of relabelling a live surface and is stated here rather than
#: discovered.

#:
#: **Not positive** for the error rule in :meth:`RoutingTrace._settle_locked`
#: and ``RoutingTraceService.persist``: a trace carrying an ``error`` still
#: settles as ``error``. Guidance is composed only from a usable classifier
#: answer, so the two do not meet on a healthy path, and a row where they do
#: belongs under ``?outcome=error``.
OUTCOME_GUIDED = "guided"

#: No producer since ``message_patterns`` was dropped everywhere (channels &
#: identity unification, settled decision §2.9). Kept because stored
#: ``routing_decision`` rows still carry it and a rendering that met an unknown
#: ``match_method`` would show a decision it could not name — the same
#: treatment ``SKIP_IDENTITY_ROUTE`` gets, and for the same reason: the
#: vocabulary is a read contract over history, not a list of what is emitted
#: today.
MATCH_PATTERN = "pattern"
MATCH_AI = "ai"
MATCH_ONLY_ONE = "only_one"
#: The sender pinned one of their own agents to this channel
#: (``channel_user_setting.pinned_agent_id``), so no classifier ran and no
#: candidate set was built: the routing question had already been answered by
#: the person whose message it is.
#:
#: Deliberately not folded into ``MATCH_ONLY_ONE``, which looks similar from
#: the outside — both mean "matched without asking a model" — and is a
#: different fact. ``only_one`` is an *inference* the router draws when the
#: choice space happens to hold exactly one thing, and it disappears the moment
#: the sender installs a second agent. A pin is a *standing instruction* that
#: holds however many agents they own, which is also why the two produce
#: different remedies: widening a trigger prompt is the answer to a bad
#: ``only_one`` and is inert against a pin.
MATCH_PINNED = "pinned"
#: The sender's message quoted a reply this platform's agent wrote in the same
#: conversation, and that agent was already on the sender's own ballot (or is a
#: reachable agent of an identity on it), so it was taken without a classifier
#: call. The quoted agent comes from the channel's delivery ledger, never from
#: the quoted text; the preference only narrows a ballot built under the
#: sender's policy and never adds to it.
#:
#: Ranked below ``MATCH_PINNED`` (a pin is the sender's standing instruction, a
#: quote is a reference inside one message) and above ``MATCH_ONLY_ONE`` (the
#: sender pointed at the agent, so there is no alternative worth probing for).
#: Written on the ``pass_1`` stage, and on the ``identity_stage2`` stage too when
#: the quoted agent belongs to an identity.
MATCH_QUOTED_REPLY = "quoted_reply"
#: The sender answered a clarifying question the router asked on their previous
#: message, and the option they chose was still on the ballot rebuilt under
#: their current policy, so it was taken without a classifier call. Like
#: ``quoted_reply`` the choice only narrows that ballot. Written on the stage
#: that took it: ``pass_1`` for an agent or identity (Stage 2 may then record a
#: method of its own), ``pass_2`` for a catalog bundle.

#: The bundle row is on the auto-install list but has no resolvable latest
#: revision — a data-integrity drop that was previously silent.
SKIP_NO_REVISION = "no_revision"
#: The route resolved to an agent id with no ``agent`` row behind it. A
#: dangling reference, not an inactive route — same distinction as
#: ``SKIP_NO_REVISION`` vs ``SKIP_NO_TRIGGER_PROMPT`` on the bundle side.
SKIP_AGENT_MISSING = "agent_missing"
#: The bundle side of ``SKIP_AGENT_MISSING``: the id that won Pass 2 has no
#: ``agent_bundle`` row behind it any more. Its own reason rather than
#: ``SKIP_NO_REVISION``, which means "published nothing" and would send the
#: reader off to publish a bundle that is simply gone.
SKIP_BUNDLE_MISSING = "bundle_missing"
#: Pass 2 held this bundle and could have offered it, but Pass 1 matched one of
#: the sender's own agents first, so the auto-install pass never classified.
#:
#: **Not a filter result** — it is the only ``skip_reason`` recorded for a
#: candidate that passed every gate. It exists because Pass 1's single-candidate
#: short-circuit scans the catalog to decide whether it may skip the classifier
#: (``ChannelRoutingService._catalog_ballot``), and that scan is written to the
#: trace so an admin can see what the choice space actually held. Recording
#: those rows as *eligible* would be the lie: they would join the
#: "N eligible candidates" the verdict counts and the near-miss ranking, and a
#: reachability diagnosis would tell somebody their bundle "was an eligible
#: candidate and the classifier did not pick it" about a classifier that was
#: never given it.
SKIP_PASS_1_MATCHED = "pass_1_matched"
#: :data:`SKIP_PASS_1_MATCHED`'s twin for a Pass 1 that ended the decision with
#: a guidance reply instead of a match: the sender asked about the assistant
#: (``help``), so the probe's bundles were never put to a classifier. Same
#: demotion from *eligible*, for the same reason.
SKIP_PASS_1_GUIDED = "pass_1_guided"
#: Identity Stage 2 only: the binding is active and accessible, but has no
#: ``IdentityBindingAssignment`` for *this* caller, so every Stage-2 path aborts
#: on it after selecting it. Distinct from "not a candidate": it was on the
#: ballot and could even win, and the request would still end nowhere.
SKIP_NO_ASSIGNMENT = "no_assignment"
#: Stage 1 only: an identity **owner** who named this caller on at least one
#: binding, but none of those bindings is currently reachable — the binding is
#: switched off, the owner disabled it for this caller, or the caller has not
#: enabled the contact. The person is therefore not on the ballot.
#:
#: Deliberately **not** ``SKIP_IDENTITY_ROUTE``, which is an older reason with
#: an unrelated meaning: *a channel decision rejected an identity route it was
#: offered*. That one describes a candidate that existed and lost; this one
#: describes a person who never became a candidate. Reusing it would make the
#: two indistinguishable in exactly the diagnosis they are read for.
SKIP_IDENTITY_UNAVAILABLE = "identity_unavailable"
#: Channel Pass 1 only: the sender **owns** this agent, and their settings for
#: this channel do not include it — the resolved ``agent_scope`` is ``"list"``
#: and the agent is not on their list, or it is ``"none"``, under which nothing
#: they own is in scope.
#:
#: Recorded rather than filtered out, and that is the whole reason it exists.
#: "You own three agents and none of them is switched on for this channel" is
#: the question a confused sender actually asks, and a candidate set that
#: merely came back shorter cannot answer it: the agent they expected would be
#: absent from the trace in exactly the way an agent that never existed is
#: absent (master plan §3.5, which this rule already cost one incident).
#:
#: **Not ``SKIP_NO_TRIGGER_PROMPT``**, and where an agent is both out of scope
#: and has no wording this reason is the one written (see
#: ``ChannelCandidateProvider.build``). The two send the reader to different
#: screens: that one says the owner has written nothing for the classifier to
#: match on and is fixed on the agent's Configuration tab, this one says the
#: agent is fine and this channel is not where it is enabled, and is fixed in
#: Settings > Channels.
SKIP_NOT_IN_CHANNEL_SCOPE = "not_in_channel_scope"

#: Why Pass 2 (auto-install from the catalog) did not run, as a closed
#: server-chosen vocabulary rather than a sentence.
#:
#: The sentence already exists — ``ChannelRoutingService`` writes one of three
#: ``PASS_2_*_NOTE`` constants into :attr:`StageTrace.reason` — and it is
#: withheld with the message-text gate off, along with every other free-text
#: stage field. That is the allowlist working as designed, and it costs the one
#: fact a reader of that trace came for: *which switch to go and look at*. These
#: codes carry that fact, and only that fact, on a field that can be served with
#: the gate closed (see :data:`SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`).
#:
#: **Assigned in the same narrowest-first if/elif chain that picks the note**
#: (:meth:`ChannelRoutingService._record_pass_2_not_run`), never computed
#: independently: that ordering *is* the diagnosis — a restricted scope
#: invalidates the auto-install remedy too — so a code derived from a second,
#: separate pass over the policy could name a control the note does not.
NOT_RUN_PINNED = "pinned"
NOT_RUN_CHANNEL_SCOPE = "channel_scope"
NOT_RUN_AUTO_INSTALL_OFF = "auto_install_off"
#: Reserved, and **not written by** ``_record_pass_2_not_run``: the admin
#: unticked ``include_catalog`` on a simulate, and the call to that recorder is
#: deliberately gated on the flag, so no note is written in that case at all —
#: reporting the policy underneath the admin's own toggle answers a question
#: nobody asked. Declared because it is the one cause a read-time
#: re-resolution could never recover: ``include_catalog`` is a per-run flag
#: persisted nowhere.
NOT_RUN_SIMULATE_TOGGLE = "simulate_toggle"

#: The vocabulary as a set, so membership is checkable rather than asserted.
#: :func:`record_parse_outcome` is public and ``update_stage`` takes arbitrary
#: field names, so "only vocabulary values reach this field" was a property no
#: code enforced — the same shape ``reason`` failed at. Coercing to ``None`` on
#: a miss also keeps :data:`SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS` total: a value whose ``__str__``
#: raises would otherwise reach the payload and fail at ``asdict``/JSON time,
#: taking the whole row down where a lost field would do.

)

#: The classifier's categorical answer — ``stages[].intent`` — as asked for by
#: ``app_agent_router_prompt.md`` and normalised by
#: ``agent_classifier._parse_intent_and_options``.
#:
#: - ``route`` — one candidate fits; ``agent_id`` names it.
#: - ``clarify`` — two or three fit about equally; ``agent_id`` is the best
#:   pick and ``options`` lists the tied candidates, best pick first.
#: - ``help`` — the message is about the assistant or the platform itself.
#: - ``none`` — a real task that no candidate fits.
#:
#: Defined here, with the other stage vocabularies, so

# --- The message-text allowlist ---------------------------------------------
#
# **This is an allowlist, and that is the whole point of it.** Read this before
# adding a field to any dataclass above.
#
# ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` exists to keep the *sender's* words out
# of what is stored and served. It was enforced three times by enumerating the
# fields that carry those words, and three times the enumeration turned out to
# be one field short:
#
#   1. ``message_text`` — gated first, and declared complete.
#   2. ``stages[].prompt`` / ``stages[].raw_response`` — found later, gated via a
#      per-field denylist, and declared complete again.
#   3. ``llm_attempts[].error`` — found after that. Provider SDK exceptions
#      routinely echo the request payload, which at the router's call site *is*
#      the rendered prompt containing the sender's message.
#
# Sender text is a taint that *propagates*: it reaches new fields by ordinary,
# reviewable-looking changes (a new diagnostic field, a wrapped exception, a
# prompt template edit). A denylist makes a newly added field default to
# **exposed** and relies on somebody noticing — which is structurally always one
# field behind. An allowlist makes a new field default to **hidden**, so the
# failure mode is a missing diagnostic (recoverable, visible, annoying) rather
# than a leak (not recoverable, and invisible until an audit finds it).
#
# So: **a field is served with the gate off only if it is named here.** Adding a
# field to ``StageTrace`` / ``CandidateTrace`` / ``LLMAttempt`` and wanting it
# visible while the gate is off is a deliberate act — name it here, and only
# after establishing that it cannot carry anything the sender wrote (not "does
# not today": ``stages[].prompt`` did not carry it either, purely because a
# markdown template happened to be longer than the clamp).
#
# Spec shape: ``field name -> None`` for a JSON scalar copied through, or a
# tuple of field names for a list of nested objects, each projected through that
# tuple. A container field declared as a scalar (``None``) is **dropped**, not
# passed through — see ``_project_safe_stages`` in ``routing_trace_service`` —
# so mis-declaring a new nested structure fails closed too.

#: Candidate identity, eligibility, and the *agent owner's own* routing
#: configuration.
#:
#: ``trigger_prompt`` and ``prompt_examples`` are admitted deliberately, and the
#: reasoning is the bar any future widening has to clear — not a precedent that
#: the list takes whatever is convenient:
#:
#:   - **They are not sender-derived.** The gate exists for *the sender's* words.
#:     These two are configuration the agent's owner wrote, and nothing the
#:     sender says can reach them.
#:   - **They are already visible to this audience.** The read API is
#:     superuser-only, and a superuser can see both through ordinary platform
#:     surfaces anyway, so admitting them changes no exposure class.
#:   - **Withholding them degraded a diagnosis unrelated to sender privacy.**
#:     The tuning card's near-miss verdict ("closest: Equation Assistant 0.31")
#:     is a Jaccard overlap computed against the trigger prompt; without it the
#:     card can say an agent lost but not how narrowly.
#:
#: A field earns a place here by being answerable on all three counts *when it
#: is added*, not by resembling something already on the list.

SAFE_OPTION_FIELDS: tuple[str, ...] = ("ref_id",)

#: The stage projection used on the write path *and* the read path (one
#: definition, so the two cannot drift into gating different fields).
#: ``prompt`` and ``raw_response`` are absent on purpose — they are the sender's
#: words — and so is anything nobody has declared safe yet.
#:
#: ``reason`` was here, and was **removed in the same change that started
#: populating it from the model.** It held our own parse literals ("classifier
#: reply was not JSON") and was safe on those terms alone. Phase 5's prompt
#: contract asks the classifier for a ``reason``, and a model explaining why it
#: chose an agent quotes the message back at us — so the field became a rewrite
#: of the sender's words, exactly like ``raw_response``, the moment that reply
#: started landing in it.
#:
#: This is the case the allowlist exists for: a field that is safe *now*, stops
#: being safe *later*, and where the default has to be that somebody thinks
#: about it rather than that nobody notices. Removing it costs a diagnostic —
#: with the gate off, "the classifier chose NONE" is no longer served — and that
#: cost is accepted, because the alternative is enumerating which reasons are
#: ours and which are the model's, which is the per-field inventory this list
#: replaced after it failed three times.
#:
#: ``not_run_code`` is on this list because it is **enum-shaped by
#: construction**: its values are the module constants above —
#: :data:`NOT_RUN_PINNED` / :data:`NOT_RUN_CHANNEL_SCOPE` /
#: :data:`NOT_RUN_AUTO_INSTALL_OFF` / :data:`NOT_RUN_SIMULATE_TOGGLE` — chosen
#: by a branch over ``ResolvedChannelPolicy``, and no sender-derived string can
#: reach it. The human sentence stays in ``reason``, and stays gated.
#:
#: **``reason``, above, is the counter-example, and it is why this is a
#: per-field judgement and never a licence.** It was on this list. It was safe
#: on the terms it was admitted under — it held our own parse literals. It had
#: to be withdrawn the moment its content began arriving from the model,
#: because a field's safety is a property of *where its content comes from*,
#: not of what it is called or of who added it.
#:
#: So the test to apply to the next candidate is not "does it look like
#: ``not_run_code``" but "can user input reach it, now or after the next change
#: to its producer". **A candidate rendered from user input must be refused,
#: and refused here, in this comment**, rather than discovered on a read
#: surface.
#:
#: ``intent`` and ``options`` pass that test, each on its producer's terms.
#: ``intent`` is coerced to :data:`CLASSIFIER_INTENTS` inside
#: :func:`record_parse_outcome`, so a model that writes the sender's words into
#: the JSON field records nothing. ``options[].ref_id`` carries only strings the
#: classifier matched **exactly** against the ballot's server-built
#: ``Candidate.ref_id`` values — the terms ``runner_up_id`` is admitted on: a
#: reply can select among those ids, it cannot author one. Neither field holds a
#: name, a description or anything from a quoted message.
#:
#: ``guidance_kind`` and ``guidance_options`` pass on the same terms.
#: ``guidance_kind`` is coerced to :data:`GUIDANCE_KINDS` inside
#: :meth:`RoutingTrace.note_guidance`. ``guidance_options[].ref_id`` are the
#: server-built ``Candidate.ref_id`` values of the entries a guidance reply
#: listed, chosen by the router from the sender's ballot — the model selects
#: the shape, it never writes an id here. The reply's text (names, trigger
#: prompts) is not on the trace at all.

           naming that agent is worse than no row at all — on the identity path

           the settler happily overwrote a recorded failure with a softer
