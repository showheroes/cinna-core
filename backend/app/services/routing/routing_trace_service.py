"""Persistence and admin reads for routing traces.

``routing_trace.py`` captures a decision in process memory and knows nothing
about databases; this module is the seam where a *closed* trace becomes a
``routing_decision`` row, and where the admin API reads them back.

**Import direction matters here.** ``app/agents/`` imports ``routing_trace``
directly, and ``app/agents/`` sits below ``app/services/``. That inversion is
harmless only because ``routing_trace`` pulls in nothing but the standard
library. This module pulls in models, a session and settings — so it must never
be re-exported from ``app/services/routing/__init__.py``, and ``routing_trace``
must never import it. Import it by its full module path from the services and
routes that need it. The rule is written at length in that ``__init__``.

Two gates decide whether a trace is written and what it may carry. **Both gate
the read path as well as the write path** — the asymmetry §7 rejects for one of
them is wrong for the other for the same reason:

- ``ROUTING_TRACE_ENABLED`` — gates **persistence, not in-process capture**
  (the wording ``config.py`` uses; the recorder cannot read settings at all, and
  the live channel debug feed's no-match diagnosis is built from a capture, so
  this flag must not touch it). Off means no row is written *and* none is
  served: :meth:`list` returns an empty page and :meth:`get` returns ``None``,
  each accompanied by :data:`TRACING_DISABLED_NOTICE`. :meth:`clear` keeps
  working while it is off — precisely so the pile an operator just stopped
  serving can still be emptied.
- ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` — the policy flag from the plan's §7.
  With it off, ``message_text`` is withheld and each stage is projected through
  ``routing_trace.SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS``: an **allowlist**, so a stage field is
  stored and served only if somebody declared it free of the sender's words, and
  a field added later defaults to hidden. This replaced a per-field denylist,
  which had the defect its shape guarantees — three rounds of enumerating the
  tainted fields each shipped one field short (``message_text``, then
  ``stages[].prompt`` / ``raw_response``, then ``llm_attempts[].error``, whose
  provider exceptions echo the request payload). Applied on the write path as
  well as the read path, from that one definition, so the property is structural
  rather than an audit's high-water mark: ``stages[].prompt`` happened not to
  contain the message only because the router prompt template overruns
  ``TRACE_TEXT_MAX_CHARS`` before the user message is appended, and a privacy
  property must not rest on the byte length of a markdown file. With the gate
  off, ``message_sha256`` plus the candidate set and verdict still answer "which
  agents were even considered". The same flag, written and read the same way,
  governs ``quoted_message_text`` and ``quoted_message_author`` — the message a
  channel sender replied to, which is a third party's words — while
  ``quoted_agent_id`` (a resolved id) is served regardless.

Neither gate erases. Both hide, and both say so, naming the two things that do
erase — retention expiry and the trace-clear endpoint.

Per-origin write policy (``app_mcp`` defaulting to metadata-only) is
**deliberately absent**: no ``origin="app_mcp"`` capture exists, so the setting
that expressed it was unreachable at every value and has been removed. Plan §4
records the condition for bringing it back — the same change that adds the
origin, never before.

Retention is the other half of that §7 argument — the case for storing message
text is that it bounds the *duration* of an exposure the debug buffer already
grants, so :meth:`purge` treats an unbounded window as something an operator has
to ask for by name (``ROUTING_TRACE_RETENTION_FOREVER``), never as the reading
of a vague value.

:meth:`persist` never raises. It is called from the routing pipeline, where a
failed diagnostic write must not cost the caller their message.

        **Opens its own short-lived session and takes no ``db`` argument.** An
        earlier version wrote through the caller's session, which was wrong in
        both directions: the ``commit`` published whatever uncommitted work the
        caller happened to be holding, and — silently, which is worse — a failed
        diagnostic write rolled the caller's work away and returned
        ``None``, indistinguishable from "tracing is off". A diagnostic must not
        be able to move the caller's transaction at all. Owning the session also
        removes the expire-on-commit hazard at every call site at once: callers
        no longer have to hoist attributes before persisting.

        **Never raises.** Called from the routing pipeline, where the caller's
        broad ``except`` would otherwise turn a failed diagnostic write into a
        dropped inbound message. A failure logs and returns ``None``.

        Call this *after* the ``RoutingTrace.capture`` block has exited, so
        ``latency_ms`` and the settled ``outcome`` are on the trace.

        **Two write gates, not one.** ``ROUTING_TRACE_ENABLED`` and
        ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` apply to every origin;
        ``ROUTING_TRACE_APP_MCP_MODE`` applies to ``origin="app_mcp"`` and
        nothing else, and can only ever store *less* than the other two would.
        Both are applied here, at the write, so what is withheld is withheld
        from the database and not merely from the API.

        The row keeps the trace's own id, so the ``trace_id`` the live channel
        debug feed already shows is the id to fetch here.

        ``preceded_by`` folds an **earlier pass of the same decision** into this
        row. Channel routing runs Pass 1 and Pass 2 in two separate worker
        threads, and §5 requires each to own its own capture — but one inbound
        message is one decision, and the plan's schema says so: ``stages`` holds
        ``pass_1`` *and* ``pass_2``. Writing a row per pass would put a
        ``no_match`` row on the ``?outcome=no_match`` filter — the one view an
        admin uses to answer "why didn't it find my agent" — for every message
        Pass 2 went on to handle successfully. So the passes merge: stages
        concatenate in order, latency sums, ``created_at`` comes from the
        *earlier* pass (the decision began when Pass 1 did, so taking Pass 2's
        would put the row's start after work it accounts for), and the terminal
        pass supplies the outcome.

        **Any ``error`` on the row promotes the outcome.** ``_route_installed``
        catches a router outage, records it, and returns ``None`` rather than
        raising — "a router outage must not 500 the webhook". So no exception
        reaches the thread target, Pass 2 runs normally, and without this the
        whole provider outage would persist as ``outcome=no_match, error=NULL``:
        the exception text gone, and ``?outcome=error`` — the filter that exists
        to surface exactly this — empty. The earlier pass's error is prefixed
        with its stage, and whenever the merged row carries an error but no
        positive verdict, the outcome is promoted to ``error``.

        That promotion is deliberately **not** limited to the ``preceded_by``
        case, and it deliberately duplicates ``RoutingTrace._settle_locked``'s
        rule. The two enforce the same invariant — *a trace carrying an error
        settles as an error* — at ends that cannot see each other:
        ``_settle_locked`` fixes the in-memory trace (which the live debug feed
        also reads, via ``summarize``), while this fixes an error arriving from
        a **different trace object** the settler was never handed. Neither is
        redundant, and the shared carve-out is the same one: a later pass that
        genuinely ``routed`` or ``parked_install``ed keeps its verdict.

        ``match_method`` falls back to the earlier pass when the later one has
        none. That is the diagnostic residue the whole feature exists for: Pass 1
        classifying a match that the ownership filter then rejected is a
        completely different story from Pass 1 seeing nothing, and only
        ``match_method`` distinguishes them.

    This was ``_scrub_stage_text``: it blanked a tuple of known-tainted field
    names. Three separate rounds of enumerating those names each shipped one
    field short — ``message_text``, then ``stages[].prompt`` /
    ``raw_response``, then ``llm_attempts[].error`` — because sender text is a
    taint that *propagates* into new fields by ordinary-looking changes, so a
    denylist is structurally always one field behind. Inverted, a field nobody
    has declared safe is simply not served, and the cost of forgetting is a
    missing diagnostic instead of a leak.

    **Nested-aware**, which the flat scrub was not: that is precisely why
    ``llm_attempts[].error`` sat outside a gate believed complete. A spec entry
    of ``None`` means "a JSON scalar, copied through"; a tuple means "a list of
    objects, each projected through these field names". A *container* declared
    as a scalar is dropped rather than passed through, so mis-declaring a newly
    added nested structure fails closed too.

    Copies rather than mutating: on the write path the input comes from
    ``stages_payload()`` (already a fresh projection), but on the read path it is
    the live ORM attribute of a ``RoutingDecision``, and mutating that in place
    would mark the row dirty and risk writing the projection back to the database
    — an erase, on a flag whose whole contract is that it does not erase.

    **Fails closed.** Anything unexpected in the stored shape drops the stage
    list entirely rather than passing it through ungated: losing a diagnostic is
