class ChannelDecline(PermissionError):
    """An access decline that will recur identically on every retry.

    Every refusal in this module raises this, and so do the two invariant
    refusals in ``ChannelInboundService._ingest``. It is the marker a caller
    uses to tell "this sender is not allowed to do this" apart from "something
    went wrong while trying".

    **Why it subclasses ``PermissionError`` rather than replacing it.** Every
    existing ``except PermissionError`` handler — the A2A handler, the App MCP
    handler, the CLI routes, ``api/deps`` — keeps working untouched, so this
    is a raise-site change and nothing else. Behaviour is identical everywhere
    that does not opt in.

    **Why a bare ``PermissionError`` was not good enough.**
    ``ChannelInboundService._drain_parked`` classifies on the exception type to
    decide a *disposition*: a deterministic decline fails the binding (which
    then self-heals by re-routing), while anything else leaves the parked
    messages parked for a later attempt. ``PermissionError`` is a subclass of
    ``OSError``, so the moment real I/O runs under ``_ingest`` — attachment
    fetching is the near one — a disk or socket error would arrive at that
    handler wearing the marker for "this will never succeed", and a transient
    failure would silently drop a queue of parked messages and fail the thread.
    The classifier needs a type that only a *decision* can raise, and
    ``OSError`` is not it.

    The decline text is for logs and the binding's ``last_error`` only. What
    the sender is told is always the one generic refusal every other denial
    gets — a reply that named the reason would be an oracle.

        The one place identity sessions are built. It used to live inline in
        ``AppMCPRequestHandler._create_identity_session``, which made "a caller
        may hold a session inside somebody else's workspace" an App-MCP-only
        capability; any surface that wanted it would have had to rebuild the
        ownership and stamping rules, and a surface that rebuilt them slightly
        differently is the failure this consolidates away.

        Ownership is the non-obvious part and does not change here:
        ``session.user_id`` is the **identity owner** (the agent runs in their
        space, on their credentials) while ``identity_caller_id`` records who
        is talking. That inversion is why the grant exists and why
        ``assert_access`` re-reads it.

        ``sender`` is a parameter rather than built here because it is the one
        thing that genuinely differs per surface: App MCP passes
        ``SessionSender.from_app_mcp(caller, identity_caller_user_id=caller)``,
        and a channel passes ``SessionSender.from_channel(...)``.
        ``integration_type`` is likewise the caller's to choose — App MCP
        identity sessions stay ``"identity_mcp"``.

        **Where the grant is actually verified.** ``assert_access`` consults
        ``policy.identity_grant`` on both its ``channel_caller`` and its
        ``mcp_caller`` arms, so the call below is a live check whichever
        surface built the sender. The ``mcp_caller`` arm gained it when the
        ``AppAgentRoute`` family was deleted: that arm used to rest on "the
        routing layer verified the caller has a route to this agent", and with
        no routes left the only thing that can authorise a session on somebody
        else's agent is the grant. App MCP additionally re-verifies identity
        per message on *resume*, in ``_check_identity_session_validity``, which
        checks liveness only — the two are complementary, not redundant.

        Raises ``PermissionError`` when the sender kind is unsupported or a
        consulted grant does not re-verify, and ``NoActiveEnvironmentError``
        when the agent has no live environment.

        **The supported kinds are named in ``_IDENTITY_SESSION_SENDER_KINDS``,
        and the check is up front.** ``_select_session_owner_id`` consumes
        ``identity_owner_id`` on the ``mcp_caller`` and ``channel_caller`` arms
        only. A sender whose arm honors no owner override would reach the body,
        create and **commit** a session owned by the caller, and only then trip
        ``_stamp_new_session``'s unknown-key ``ValueError``: a wrong session
        that already exists, plus an unhandled error. Rejecting the kind before
        any write turns that tripwire into a guard — which is why that set and
        the owner arms are edited together, never one without the other.

        **The channel path does not come through here.** Phase 3 routes an
        identity-selected channel message through ``ingest_inbound_message``
        (plan §2.3), the door that also carries the message text and supports
        resume — neither of which this method does. ``channel_caller`` is on
        the allowlist so the two lists agree, not because a channel calls this.

                # exception the second message in an HR thread is refused,
                # permanently. It is permitted only when the session names this
                # very sender as its identity caller; nothing wider, and in
                # particular never "the session has an identity caller".

                # This is a *linkage* check, not the authorization. The
                # authorization is `assert_access`, which runs BEFORE this
                # method on every message (`ingest_inbound_message` step 1,
                # ahead of `resolve_or_create_session`) and re-reads the whole
                # grant reconstructed from this row — so a revoked sender is

                # boundary invites the wrong one being removed.** The exception
                # is self-standing: its condition compares
                # `existing.identity_caller_id` against the sender on the
                # session row itself, so a deliberately mismatched
                # `(binding, user)` pair — binding owned by X, session owned by
                # HR with `identity_caller_id = X`, called with a sender whose
                # `platform_user_id` is Z — fails the comparison and raises
                # here, with no help from anything upstream.
                #
                # The upstream thread-ownership invariant is what protects the
                # **unchanged non-identity arm** above (`existing.user_id ==
                # sender.platform_user_id`), where the binding pinning
                # `session_id` plus "the sender is the binding's user" is the
                # whole argument. That invariant is enforced, not merely
