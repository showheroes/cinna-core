"""
Environment Resolver — shared helpers for resolving and auto-activating an
agent's active environment.

These helpers were originally part of ``AgentSchedulerService`` and are reused
by any feature that needs to run code inside an agent's Docker environment on
behalf of a backend-initiated action (scheduled script triggers, webhook
script triggers, etc.). Keeping them in a dedicated module avoids cross-service
coupling.

Both helpers are static-style functions — no state, no class — to make reuse
explicit and test-friendly.

    The light counterpart to :func:`ensure_environment_running`: it activates a
    suspended env and returns, rather than polling to a running state and
    raising. That is what a user-initiated **refresh** wants — a cache pull
    should wake a sleeping agent, but must never turn into a 120-second request
    or a 500 because the container is unhealthy.

    No-op when the env is already running, when no agent is available, or for
    any status other than ``suspended``: ``stopped`` / ``error`` need a heavier
    full start that a refresh button has no business triggering.

    Activation rotates the env auth token, so the refreshed ``status`` /
    ``status_changed_at`` / ``config`` are copied back onto the caller's
    instance — including when a *parallel* request did the activation, which is
    why the copy-back happens unconditionally. ``status_changed_at`` travels
    with ``status`` as a value copy: re-stamping it here would hide the real
    age of the transition from the status-repair reconciler.

    Never raises: a failure leaves the caller on its normal not-running path.
