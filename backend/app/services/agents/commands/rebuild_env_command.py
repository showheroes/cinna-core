/rebuild-env command - rebuild the active environment for the current agent.

Performs the same operation as clicking the "Rebuild" button on the environment
panel. Rebuilds the Docker image with updated core files while preserving
workspace data. Fails if any session connected to this environment is actively
streaming.
