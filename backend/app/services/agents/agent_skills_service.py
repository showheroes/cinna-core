"""AgentSkillsService — reads and caches the agent's skill index.

An agent's skills live in its workspace at ``skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` (plus the
skills that arrive with installed plugins). env-core parses them and serves the
index at ``GET /config/skills``; this service pulls that index and caches it on
the :class:`~app.models.environments.environment.AgentEnvironment` row so the
agent page, the ``/skills`` command and the slash-command popup can read it
without waking a suspended container.

Same shape as :class:`~app.services.agents.cli_commands_service.CLICommandsService`
— that is deliberate, it is the established pull-only cache pattern — with two
differences that matter:

* **Write short-circuit.** When the reported index equals the cached one,
  nothing is written and no event is emitted: the refresh is one HTTP round
  trip and the DB is untouched. This is the common case, because it fires after
  every stream and every cron run. The comparison is on the index CONTENT, not
  on the reported tree hash — the hash covers the workspace ``skills/`` folder
  only, while the index also carries plugin skills.
* **Its own rate-limit bucket.** The 30 s per-environment window is independent
  of the CLI-commands one; two caches sharing a bucket would let a busy agent's
  status pull starve its skills pull.

The cache is env-authoritative and never written back: nothing here can change
what the engine sees. A stale cache costs a wrong card, never a wrong agent.
