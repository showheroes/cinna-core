"""AddonsService — one deduplicated list of everything an agent carries.

The agent page used to answer "what can this agent do?" twice: the Plugins tab
listed ``AgentPluginLink`` rows, the Skills card listed the environment's skill
index, and a catalog install appeared in both. They are not two answers to two
questions — they are two halves of one, and the seam between them was visible
to the user.

This service joins the halves **on the server**, so the tab, the CLI and any
later consumer fold them the same way (§2 of the plan):

1. every plugin link is one row — ``kind="skill"`` for a catalog link (it wraps
   exactly one skill) and for a ``skills``-format marketplace entry (the same
   thing by another road), ``kind="plugin"`` for everything else;
2. every ``source="local"`` index entry is one row;
3. index entries that belong to a plugin are **not** rows: they hang off their
   plugin's row as ``skills[]``, which is what removes the double listing;
4. an index entry whose plugin has no link — a plugin uninstalled but not yet
   pruned from the workspace — hangs off a synthetic *orphan* row, because
   something the engine can still load must not be invisible here.

Two properties this service is built around:

**It never writes and never calls a container.** The skill half comes from the
cached index on the environment row (the same read path
``GET /agents/{id}/skills`` uses). Every mutation stays on the existing plugin
and skills routes, so there is exactly one place that installs a plugin.

**The skill half failing must not take the plugin half with it.** A sleeping
environment, an ``adapter_error`` on a pre-feature container: the projection
still returns every link row and reports the reason in ``skills_error``.

        (which a publisher may edit at any time), so matching on that would
        silently stop folding the row's own skill into it.

        A marketplace link whose plugin row was deleted (``plugin_id`` is

        Errors are resolved before warnings, and a link-level failure counts as
        an error of its own: a row whose upstream is gone — a catalog package
        or revision, a marketplace plugin — often ships no skills at all, so
        waiting for a skill to complain would leave the most broken row in the
        list looking healthy.

        ``index_readable`` carries the same reasoning one step further, for the
        row that ships no skills because it never landed. It is a tri-state on
        purpose: absence is only evidence when the index was read (``True``),
        it is *unknown* while the read is failing (``False``), and it says
        nothing at all before the first read (``None``).

        Two conditions make an empty row's absence mean nothing, and both were
        missing from the first cut of this rule:

        * **A disabled link contributes no skills by design.** env-core builds
          the index from ``active_plugins``, which skips every entry flagged
          ``disabled`` — so a user turning a skill off (a supported verb) would
          otherwise be told, permanently, that its files never arrived.
        * **An index older than the link has not looked yet.** The addons read
          is cache-only, so a fresh install is projected against whatever was
          last fetched. Judging absence on a read that predates the install
          reports every successful install as broken until the next refresh.
