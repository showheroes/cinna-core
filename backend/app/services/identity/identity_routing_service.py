"""Identity Stage 2 — which of *this person's* agents should take the message.

Stage 1 resolves a person (``IdentityCandidateProvider`` puts them on the
ballot); Stage 2 resolves an agent from that person's portfolio, filtered to
what the specific caller may reach. Two stages is also the recursion cap: an
identity's agents are agents, never further identities, and that is the
intended guard.

**This module is written to the four structural facts in
``channel_routing_service.py``'s module docstring**, because
``ChannelRoutingService.decide`` calls this from inside itself: Stage 1 puts a
person on the ballot, and a person winning hands off here. A violation of any
of the four *here* is therefore a violation *there*, one call deeper, on a
route documented as having no side effects. Same four, same numbering:

1. **No caller session crosses the boundary.** ``route_within_identity`` takes
   ids and text. It cannot add to, commit, or roll back a transaction the
   caller is holding, and a caller therefore cannot be surprised by what a
   routing decision did to its unit of work.
2. **The session it opens is read-only in practice.** One short-lived session,
   ``SELECT``s only, closed on the way out. No ``add`` / ``commit`` /
   ``delete`` anywhere in this module.
3. **Nothing effectful is imported here.** No binding model, no ingestion,
   install or outbound service. Those names are not in this module's namespace,
   so no branch added later can reach one by accident — it would have to add
   the import, which is visible in a diff.
4. **It returns plain data.** ``IdentityRoutingResult`` carries ids and two
   strings read off rows *inside* that session — never an ORM instance, whose
   session is closed by the time the caller sees it and whose next attribute
   read would be a lazy reload against a dead connection.

**These four are executed, not reviewed.**
``tests/architecture/channel_routing_purity_test.py`` used to parse one module
path and this list was a claim — the one kind of claim a reader has no way to
spot as false. That test is now parameterized over both modules, closing it the
second of the two ways this docstring proposed: the change that calls Stage 2
from inside ``decide`` did it, because that is the point at which a violation
here becomes a violation there. As with the list over there, do not extend this
one without extending that test in the same change.

Not a structural fact and stated separately for that reason: the trace this
module writes is the ambient ``RoutingTrace`` recorder, which is a no-op when
nobody opened a capture. Before the channels & identity unification nobody ever
did on this path, so every recorder call here was dead instrumentation; the
channel Pass-1 capture is now open around it.

**A preference is not a grant.** ``route_within_identity`` may be handed a
``preferred_agent_id`` — on the channel path, the agent whose reply the sender
quoted. It is honoured only when that agent is one of the bindings this caller
can already reach with an assignment, which is the set every other branch here
chooses among, so a preference can pick and never widen.
:meth:`IdentityRoutingService.agent_reachable` asks that question for a caller
deciding whether to pass one, with the same reads and without recording.

**Glob pre-matching is gone.** ``IdentityAgentBinding.message_patterns`` is no
longer read here (settled decision §2.9 of the channels/identity unification
master plan): a second routing mechanism with silently higher priority than the
classifier, which no trace explains well, is worse than one classifier call.
The field is gone from the model and its DTOs; the column is dropped by the
phase's own migration.

        classifier as context only (plain strings; never authority). Only the
        channel path supplies one.

        ``preferred_agent_id`` is an agent the caller already has reason to
        route to — on the channel path, the agent whose reply the sender
        quoted. It is taken without a classifier call **only** when it is one of
        the caller's reachable bindings with an assignment; otherwise the steps
        below run unchanged. Only the channel path supplies one.

        Algorithm:
        1. Get active bindings accessible to ``caller_user_id``
        2. If none → return ``None``
        3. If ``preferred_agent_id`` is one of them, with an assignment → use it
        4. If one → use directly (no classifier call)
        5. Otherwise classify

        The **single-binding shortcut** in step 4 stays a Stage-2 property and
        is not flattened into Stage 1 (master plan §2.15): Stage 1 chose a
        *person*, and whether that person happens to have exactly one reachable
        agent is not a fact Stage 1's ballot can hold without re-deriving the
        caller's access for every candidate on it.

        Opens its own database session — see fact 1 in the module docstring.

        **Cost, stated because it is not free.** Both callers hold a session
        across this call, so an identity request occupies two pooled
        connections instead of one while Stage 2 runs — App MCP holds the
        request's own session, and the channel path holds Pass 1's worker-thread
        session (``ChannelRoutingService._route_identity`` runs inside
        ``_route_installed``, which owns one). The difference between them is
        which transaction is outstanding: App MCP's is the caller's own unit of
        work, the channel's is a read-only pass that commits nothing. Holding a
        connection while waiting for a second is the classic pool-exhaustion
        deadlock, and identity routing is not a hot path today — but if it
        becomes one, this is the line to revisit, not the pool size.
