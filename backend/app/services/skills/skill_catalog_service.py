"""SkillCatalogService — publish, browse and install server-catalog skills.

The catalog is the third and last way a skill can reach an agent, after the
agent's own ``skills/`` folder and a plugin's. It deliberately reuses the two
mechanisms that already exist rather than inventing a third:

* **Publish** is bundle publish in miniature — read the publisher's live
  workspace off disk, validate, snapshot atomically into immutable storage,
  append a revision row. Same source of truth, same ``.tmp`` → move discipline,
  same "derived, never authored" posture towards metadata.
* **Install** is a plugin install — an ``AgentPluginLink(source=catalog)``
  under the synthetic marketplace ``cinna-skills``. The container materialises
  it through the ordinary plugin manifest, so per-mode toggles, disable, prune
  on uninstall, the failure banner and the bundle-snapshot path all work with
  no new transport.

Two decisions worth knowing before reading the code:

**Publishing does not need a running container.** The publisher's workspace is
bind-mounted on the host at ``<ENV_INSTANCES_DIR>/<env id>/app/workspace``, so
a *suspended* environment publishes exactly like a running one — the same
reason ``PublishService`` never starts a container to publish a bundle. Waking
the environment would cost 30–120 s and change nothing about the bytes being
read. What is refused (409) is an agent with **no environment at all** or one
whose workspace has never been materialised on disk: there is nothing to read,
and the fix is "start the environment once", which is a sentence the dialog can
show.

**Install counts are computed, not stored.** See the note on
:class:`~app.models.skills.skill_package.SkillPackage`.

        ``package_id_taken`` — a refusal whose only fix is "open Advanced and
        invent a reverse-DNS name", asked of someone who did nothing wrong.

        So the collision is resolved rather than reported: the publisher's own
        8-hex slug (the one :meth:`BundleIdService.generate_bundle_id` uses) is
        appended, then a counter if even that is taken. The second element of
        the return is what the Share dialog needs to *show* the disambiguated
        id rather than spring it on the publisher after the fact.

        Read-then-write, so two simultaneous first publishes of the same skill
        name can still both pick the same free id; the unique constraint is
        what actually decides, and the loser sees ``package_id_taken``. The
        publish lock is keyed per ``(publisher, skill)`` and cannot close a
        race between two *different* publishers.
