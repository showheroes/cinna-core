"""Install Readiness Gate (Phase 4 of install-experience-redesign).

The gate is a stateless function over an install's credential link state.
It is invoked at every user→agent dispatch boundary (chat, MCP, A2A,
webhook) BEFORE any LLM call.

Returns a :class:`GateResult` describing one of three states:

* ``"ready"`` — the install has every credential it needs; let the
  request through.
* ``"needs_setup"`` — at least one user-provided credential is still a
  placeholder. The setup page collects them.
* ``"publisher_broken"`` — at least one publisher-provided credential is
  missing / unshared. The publisher must fix this; the installer can
  optionally provide their own override credential via the setup page.

**Catalog skill credentials never block (D1).** A credential linked because a
catalog skill on the agent requires it — and not also claimed by the agent's
bundle revision — is dropped from the missing list. A skill is one capability
among many on an agent, unlike a bundle whose specs are its contract, so an
unfilled skill slot is a warning on the skill's Addons row, in the install
response and in the container SDK, not a refusal on every channel. Bundle
verdicts are unchanged (I10). See ``_drop_skill_provisioned``.

A publisher credential that *cannot* be shared is deliberately none of these.
The install links the installer's own AI credential in its place and runs, so
nothing is missing and the gate stays out of the way — see the note at the
unshareable branch in ``_scan_publisher_ai``.

The gate is purely a read-side helper. It DOES NOT mutate state, write
events, or persist anything. Callers are responsible for: persisting a
synthesised system-message reply, emitting WS events, and short-circuiting
their channel-specific message dispatch.

See ``docs/drafts/install-experience-redesign_plan.md`` §6 (gate shape)
and §9 (security) for the full spec.
