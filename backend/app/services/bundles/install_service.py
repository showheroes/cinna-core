"""InstallService — install / uninstall / apply-update for ``Agent`` rows.

The ``Agent`` table is the "Install" table in the new model. Every Install
row has a ``bundle_id`` (reverse-DNS string); foreign installs additionally
link a ``bundle_uuid`` and ``installed_revision_id`` so we know what's
running where.

Key flows:

- ``install_bundle``: idempotent (one install per ``(user, bundle_uuid)``).
  Creates a fresh Agent row, an environment seeded from the bundle's
  latest revision, ensures the per-user app-data volume, and starts the
  env. Credentials are bound from user selections + auto-share rules
  inherited from the legacy clone path.

- ``apply_update``: stops the env, calls
  ``EnvironmentLifecycleManager.replace_bundle_content()`` to swap the
  bundle folders (preserving ``app-data/`` + ``credentials/``), restarts.

- ``uninstall``: marks the user's app-data volume orphaned BEFORE the
  Agent row is deleted (``AppDataService.wipe_volume`` requires
  ``is_orphaned=true``); deletes the env (DOWN -v on the env workspace
  volume); deletes the Agent row.

- ``check_for_updates`` / ``set_update_mode``: small read/write helpers.

        """Filter a publisher-authored per-mode model override before import.

        An ``openai_compatible`` model id names a model inside the *endpoint
        owner's* namespace — it is only meaningful against the ``base_url`` of
        the credential serving that mode. The consumer runs against their OWN
        ``openai_compatible`` credential: a different endpoint, a different
        model catalogue. So a model id the publisher pinned is very likely not
        served there, and it would win anyway — ``resolve_model`` honours any
        truthy override verbatim and returns BEFORE its ``openai_compatible``
        branch, so an imported id outranks the consumer's own
        ``openai_compatible_model``. The result is a hard provider error on the
        first message, behind a green badge (``model_health_service`` reports
        ``openai_compatible`` as always OK, on the assumption that whoever set
        the model also owns the endpoint — exactly what importing breaks).

        Therefore: for a mode that resolves to ``openai_compatible`` we drop the
        imported override and let the installer's own fallback chain decide (see
        below). Every other provider names models in a shared, portable
        namespace, so the publisher's pin is kept.

        This is deliberately scoped to IMPORTED (publisher-authored) overrides
        and MUST NOT be folded into ``resolve_model``: that code path cannot
        tell who authored an override, so the same rule there would also break
        the legitimate case of a user deliberately pinning a model on their own
        ``openai_compatible`` environment.

        What takes the pin's place is ``EnvironmentService.create_environment``'s
        pre-existing chain, which passing ``None`` here hands control to:
        the installer's own ``User.default_model_override_*`` when they have one
        set (the new-environment form pre-fills from it), and only when that is
        NULL does the serving credential's configured ``model`` stand. So even
        when the bundle ships the publisher's own AI credential
        (publisher-provided credentials), the outcome is the publisher's default
        on that endpoint only for an installer with no personal global default —
        otherwise it is that personal default. Either way it is a model the
        installer's own account chose, which is the point; the per-user
        substitution itself is how every environment this user creates already
        behaves and is not something this filter introduces.

        Note this also fires on self-checkout: ``checkout`` of a Git repo you
        authored yourself installs through the same path, so an
        ``openai_compatible`` override you set is dropped even though publisher
        and consumer are the same person on the same endpoint. That is accepted
        — the override lands in a durable environment row while the credential
        binding behind it stays mutable, so a later swap to a different
        ``openai_compatible`` credential would carry the pin onto a foreign
        endpoint. Keeping the suppression unconditional avoids that.

        (``BUNDLE_INSTALL_POLICY``); this method owns the transaction and
        maps a ``ProvisioningSelectionError`` to the HTTP 422.

        ``required_credential_specs`` lives on the revision; for each spec
        we either link a foreign publisher-shared credential (when the
        spec is ``provided_by="publisher"``) or create a placeholder /
        link the installer's selection (``provided_by="user"``).

        Backward-compat reader: spec dicts authored before Phase 1 of the
        install-experience-redesign plan have no ``provided_by`` /
        ``publisher_credential_id`` fields. We default missing
        ``provided_by`` to ``"user"`` and missing ``publisher_credential_id``
        to ``None``, which keeps install-time behaviour unchanged for
        every pre-Phase-1 revision.

        Phase 3: ``user_provided_data`` arrives normalised via
        :meth:`_normalise_credentials_payload` — values are dicts with
        ``mode`` and optional ``credential_id``. Legacy single-string and
        raw-dict values from older clients are accepted there.

        Validation (plan §5):
          - ``mode="use_existing"`` for a publisher-provided spec is
            rejected with 422 (publisher specs are not user-overridable).
          - ``mode="use_existing"`` with a credential_id that doesn't
            belong to the installer falls back to placeholder (existing
            soft behaviour; surfacing a hard error here would break old
            tests sending best-effort uuids).

        Degradation, not failure: if the publisher branch fails (missing
        row, ``allow_sharing=false``, share creation hiccup) we log a
        warning, mark the install ``last_update_status="degraded"``, and
        fall through to the placeholder path. The runtime gate (Phase 4)
        will surface this to the user; Phase 2+ just keeps the install

        Four questions, asked in the order the code asks them, and the position
        of the third is what the last pass got wrong.

        1. **Does the row still exist?** A vanished credential is not linkable.
        2. **Is it the installer's own row?** Always linkable, and asked before
           anything that costs a query; the publisher installing their own
           bundle needs no share.
        3. **Does the installer already hold a share?** Then link it: it is
           working right now. ``is_shareable`` answers whether a share may be
           *created*, and the widening that made every admin-managed child
           unshareable deleted no existing rows — so asking the policy first
           silently dropped a credential that a live ``AICredentialShare`` was
           still serving, on the next reinstall of a bundle that had been
           installing fine. Leaving those rows alone is a deliberate, accepted
           trade: revoking them would break working installs, and the price is
           that such a share can stay live indefinitely if its publisher never
           publishes again. The publisher is told, with the action to take, at
           publish time (``PublishService.publisher_ai_credential_notices``).
        4. **Could a share be made?** Answered by the same predicate the share
           path enforces rather than by inferring from the absence of a row:
           "no share exists" is a symptom shared by a transient failure and by a
           permanent policy refusal, and only one of those should stop the
           credential being linked on a later reinstall.

        and ``last_update_attempt_at`` — unconditionally, so that *every* failed
        attempt restarts the backoff window no matter which stage it failed at.

        Both writes are needed, and both must be unconditional:

        - A failure raised *before* the attempt-stamp commit (from the row-lock

          timestamp were left at the value written by the *first* failure, the
          row would be deferred for one backoff window and then, once that
          window expired, be retried every sweep forever — the same hot loop,

        the attempt seconds earlier) costs one UPDATE on a row that is failing
        anyway; correctness of the gate is worth more than avoiding it.
