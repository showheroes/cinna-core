"""
Account-CLI context package.

Assembles the *orchestrator context package* downloaded by ``cinna account
setup`` into the account workspace's ``context/`` tree. The package is the
platform's self-knowledge, delivered to a local coding agent that drives a
multi-agent network from the account root.

Contents (static platform knowledge only — never any user-specific secret):

  context/
    README.md                 # package index the orchestrator CLAUDE.md points at
    VERSION                   # content hash of this package (staleness check)
    platform/                 # curated business-logic docs (glossary, feature map)
      README.md               #   = docs/README.md (the feature map entrypoint)
      application/ agents/    #   business-logic feature docs (no *_tech files)
    api_reference/            # generated REST API reference, one file per domain
    examples/                 # working API-script patterns (platform_helper + samples)
    guides/                   # hand-authored worked playbooks (e.g. build a network)
    local-kit/                # the Local Agent Kit, rendered — conventions for
                              #   agents built locally with a coding assistant

Source of truth
---------------
The package is assembled from the committed ``platform-knowledge-env`` template
snapshot (``…/knowledge/platform/`` + ``…/scripts/examples/`` +
``…/knowledge/guides/`` + ``…/knowledge/local-kit/``). That snapshot is
the only copy of this knowledge present inside the backend container at runtime
— the repo-root ``docs/`` tree and ``frontend/openapi.json`` are not shipped in
the image. The snapshot is refreshed by
``.cinna-core-kit/scripts/sync_platform_knowledge.py`` (which shares the
API-reference generation logic with this service via
``platform_knowledge_assets``).

Transport: a gzip tarball, mirroring the per-agent workspace clone
(``CLIService.get_workspace_tarball``), so the CLI reuses one extract path.

Freshness: the snapshot only changes when the sync script is re-run (a deploy
artifact, not per-request work). The built tarball is therefore cached in-process
and keyed by the snapshot directories' newest mtime, so a redeploy that ships a
fresh snapshot invalidates the cache automatically without per-request tar work.

Staleness, on the other side of the wire, is the CLI's problem: a workspace set
up before a guide existed has no way to notice. So the package carries a
**content** version — ``context/VERSION``, also served as the
``X-Context-Package-Version`` response header and by
``GET /cli/account/context-package/version`` — that the CLI can compare against
what is on disk. It is a hash of the packaged content, deliberately not the
mtime-based cache key: a redeploy that ships byte-identical knowledge must not
tell every workspace it is behind.
