    ``onupdate`` and is never bumped here, ``last_activity_at`` is bumped by
    usage-intent, and ``last_health_check`` is written only on success.

    The stamp is deliberately unconditional rather than transition-only.
    Re-asserting the *same* status is not a no-op here: it means a new operation
    just started on a row that was already in that status — the reachable case
    being a user clicking Activate on an environment stuck at ``starting`` from
    a crash hours ago (``activate_environment`` has no transitional-status
    guard, and adding one would take away the user's only way out). Keeping the
    old clock there would hand a live activation a stale one, and the reconciler
    would reap a genuinely in-flight operation within one tick. Re-stamping
    cannot hide a stuck row instead, because a wedged operation writes nothing
    at all — the only same-status re-assert in the lifecycle is the "rebuilding"
    write a few seconds into the same rebuild.

    Does not touch the session — callers keep their own ``add()``/``commit()``,
    which is what makes the transitional status visible to the UI mid-operation.

    assignment leaves ``status_changed_at`` pointing at the previous transition

    ``status_message`` — "Building template image...", "Installing custom
    packages...", "Syncing credentials..." — and each of those writes is proof
    that the operation is *still alive*.

    That is what makes ``status_changed_at`` a **liveness heartbeat** and not
    merely a start timestamp, which is what the status-repair reconciler needs:
    its build threshold then reads "no lifecycle progress for 60 minutes",
    rather than the much more dangerous "this build started 60 minutes ago". A
    genuinely slow build keeps re-stamping the clock and is never reaped; a
    build whose process died stops writing entirely, because the write and the
    work are the same thread of execution. A dead operation cannot fake a
    heartbeat.

    Like ``_set_status`` this does not touch the session — callers keep their
    own ``add()``/``commit()``, and the commit is what publishes the heartbeat
    to the reconciler (which runs in another process, or at least another

        Rebuild environment with updated core files while preserving workspace.

        Docker terminology: 'docker-compose down' + 'docker-compose up'

        This operation:
        1. Checks if container is running
        2. Stops container if running (docker-compose stop)
        3. Deletes container (docker-compose down) - NEW container will be created
        4. Updates core files from template
        5. Ensures the shared per-template image is up-to-date (rebuilds only if hash changed)
        6. Starts NEW container if it was running before (docker-compose up) using the shared image
        7. Setup new container (install packages, etc.)
        8. Syncs dynamic data (prompts and credentials)

            from here rather than probed by the caller beforehand because this
            is the reading the rebuild itself branched on, so the two can never
            disagree about a container that started or stopped in between.

        Copy workspace from source to target environment.

        Used when switching environments for the same agent to maintain workspace
        state. Both envs belong to the SAME install (same user, same agent), so
        this is a full workspace clone — it uses the ENV_MIGRATION profile from
        ``workspace_classification``:

        Copies every top-level ``app/workspace/`` entry EXCEPT the runtime dirs
        ``logs/`` + ``databases/``, the ``app-data/`` bind mount (which follows
        the volume, not the copy), and the ``__init__.py`` template marker. This
        means the bundle-owned set (``scripts/``, ``docs/``, ``knowledge/``,
        ``files/``, ``webapp/``, ``agent_api/``, ``plugins/``, the two
        ``workspace_*.txt`` files) PLUS ``credentials/`` + ``uploads/`` PLUS any
        custom top-level dir the agent created — the old static list missed
        custom dirs.

        ``plugins/`` is a straight copy here (no merge): env-switch is same-user
        same-agent and never cross-revision, so there are no foreign consumer
        plugins to preserve.

        Args:
            source_env: Source environment to copy from
            target_env: Target environment to copy to
