class LocalFilesAccessInterface(ABC):
    """
    Optional mixin for adapters that can provide direct local filesystem access
    to workspace files without requiring the container to be running.

    This is a capability interface — it is NOT required by EnvironmentAdapter.
    Adapters that implement this interface allow features like dashboard blocks
    to read files directly from disk, bypassing container communication entirely.

    The design is intentionally encapsulated within the adapter layer:
    - Callers check ``isinstance(adapter, LocalFilesAccessInterface)`` to detect support
    - Adapters that do NOT implement this interface fall back to the standard
      ``download_workspace_item()`` path, which requires the container to be running

    In distributed or cloud environments, adapters may still implement this interface
    if they auto-sync workspace files to a local cache directory, making the interface
    valid even in multi-server setups.

        Security:
