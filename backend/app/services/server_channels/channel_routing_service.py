"""Channel routing, split from its effects.

``ChannelRoutingService.decide`` answers one question — *which agent or bundle
should this message go to* — and does nothing else. It creates no thread
binding, no session, no install, and sends no reply. ``ChannelInboundService``
composes it as ``decide()`` → bind → ingest; ``POST /admin/routing/simulate``
calls ``decide()`` and stops.

**Why this is a module and not a ``simulate=True`` flag.** A flag threaded
through the pipeline makes "simulate has no side effects" a property somebody
has to keep true at every branch, forever, including branches added later by
someone who never read this docstring. The split makes it a property of the
*call graph*: simulate cannot bind, because nothing reachable from ``decide``
binds. Four structural facts hold that up, and each is worth preserving
deliberately —

1. **No caller session crosses the boundary.** ``decide`` takes ids and text,
   never a ``Session``. It therefore cannot add to, commit, or roll back a
   transaction the caller is holding. (This is also the rule ``run_in_thread``
   already enforced for the worker targets, applied one level up.)
2. **The sessions it opens are read-only in practice.** Both thread targets
   open a short-lived session, issue ``SELECT``s through
   ``ChannelCandidateProvider`` / ``IdentityCandidateProvider`` /
   ``CatalogService``, and close it. Neither calls ``add``/``commit``/
   ``delete``, and ``create_session`` does not commit on exit. Identity
   Stage 2 opens a third such session of its own, under the same rule and for
   the same reason — see the identity paragraph below. Note the pairing is
   not one service per pass: Pass 1 reads the
   catalog too, through the same ``CatalogService``, when its single-candidate
   short-circuit needs to know whether Pass 2 could offer this sender anything
   (see ``_catalog_ballot``). That read is an availability probe — it selects,
   and it neither classifies nor installs.
3. **Nothing effectful is imported here.** No ``ChannelThreadBinding``, no
   ``ChannelOutboundService``, no ingestion or install service. Those names are
   not in this module's namespace, so no branch added later can reach them by
   accident — it would have to add the import, which is visible in a diff.
   ``tests/architecture/channel_routing_purity_test.py`` fails if one appears.
4. **It returns plain data.** Ids and recorders, never ORM instances attached
   to somebody's session — the passes' sessions are closed by the time the
   caller sees the result, so a row handed out here turns the caller's next
   attribute read into a lazy reload against a dead session. The same test
   pins ``decide``'s return type and every field on ``RoutingDecisionResult``
   against an allowlist of plain-data types.

Each of the four is executed by that test, and that is the point of stating
them: a structural fact asserted only in prose is a claim, not a guarantee.
This list is not to be extended without extending the test in the same change
— it was written claiming four while the test enforced three, which put the
fact a reader most needed in the one place nothing would catch it.

**Identity Stage 2 runs inside this boundary, and inherits all four.** When
Stage 1's ballot puts a *person* on it (``IdentityCandidateProvider``, gated on
``policy.allow_identity_routing``) and that person wins, ``decide`` hands off to
``IdentityRoutingService.route_within_identity``, which resolves *which of that
person's agents* takes the message. It is called from inside ``decide``, so the
four facts above are facts about it too: a caller session it accepted, a write
it made, an effect it imported, or an ORM row it returned would each be that
violation one call deeper — and would land on a route documented as having no
side effects. ``identity_routing_service.py``'s own module docstring states the
same four; the purity test is parameterized over both modules, so that
statement is executed there rather than reviewed.

What crosses back from Stage 2 is ``IdentityGrant`` — three UUIDs on a frozen
dataclass — carried on :class:`RoutingDecisionResult` for the caller to hand to
``ChannelIngestionService.assert_access``, which **re-reads and re-verifies**
every one of them. This module never treats the grant as a conclusion, and
nothing downstream may either: the decision and the session are separated by a
thread hop, and the identity owner may have revoked in between.

**Channel policy arrives as a value, and is never looked up here.** ``decide``
takes a ``ResolvedChannelPolicy`` — the sender's agent scope, their pinned
agent, and whether the auto-install pass may run — resolved by
``ChannelPolicyService`` in the caller, which has a session and a
``ServerChannel`` row. Only the frozen dataclass crosses into this module, and
that is fact 1 restated in the shape this feature needed it: importing
``ChannelPolicyService`` here would put a resolution — three ``SELECT``s — on
the far side of a boundary whose whole guarantee is that it holds no caller
session, and the row it resolves from would then have to cross too. Every
inherit rule lives in exactly one place (that service's docstring says so),
and this module deliberately cannot re-derive one.

**A quoted message arrives as a value too, and it is never authority.**
``decide`` takes an optional ``QuotedContext`` — the text and author label of
the message the sender replied to, as the transport carried it — built by the
caller from the inbound message. It is a frozen dataclass of strings (the
purity test pins it as plain data), and it goes to exactly one kind of place:
the classifier calls, as a fenced, context-only prompt section. It never
touches the ballot, the pin, the policy or an identity grant; ``text`` — and
the trace's ``message_text`` and ``message_sha256`` — stay the sender's own
words; and without it every prompt is byte-identical to an unquoted message's.
The rendered prompt does carry the quote, so ``stages[].prompt`` (and any model
echo in ``raw_response`` / ``reason``) can hold quoted text on the trace, under
the same ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` gate as the sender's own text.

``quoted_agent_id`` arrives the same way: a plain UUID naming the agent whose
channel turn wrote the quoted message. The caller resolves it from the delivery
ledger, a join through the thread-binding table this module may not name. It
lets Pass 1 take an agent that is **already on this sender's ballot** (or a
reachable agent of an identity that is) without classifying; it never puts an
agent on the ballot.

The only write the routing pass makes is the routing trace itself, and on the
**happy path** it is deliberately outside ``decide``: the caller persists,
because only the caller knows whether Pass 1 was the whole decision or its first
half (``RoutingDecisionResult.persist_args`` encodes that rule so both callers
apply it identically).

On the **error path** it is inside. Each thread target writes its own
``outcome=error`` trace before re-raising, because ``capture`` re-raises
unchanged and the caller therefore never receives that recorder — an error
decision, the single most useful row this table can hold, would otherwise be the
one outcome no code path can produce. **Callers must account for that:** an
exception out of ``decide`` means a trace has *already* been persisted, and
``RoutingTuningService.simulate`` points the admin at that row rather than
reporting a bare failure over the top of it. ``RoutingTraceService.persist``
opens its own session for the reasons its docstring gives, so none of this can
reach a caller's transaction.

Both passes are offloaded to a worker thread. Routing ends in a blocking LLM
HTTP call and the callers run on the event loop, so inline execution would
stall every other request and stream in the process for the duration of the
provider cascade — externally triggerable, since any whitelisted sender can
open a thread.

#:

        argument with a ``None`` default, after the pre-existing ones, because
        ``run_in_thread`` forwards positionals only; later additions go after
        it.

        ``quoted_agent_id`` is the agent whose reply the sender quoted, when

        does with it and why it can only narrow. It follows ``quoted`` on both

        answering for it.

        ``origin`` / ``actor_user_id`` travel onto the trace unchanged. Simulate

        makes a simulated decision distinguishable from a real one in the admin

        an origin resolved from the transport that accepted the message
        (``_trace_origin`` in ``channel_inbound_service``), so it is
        ``server_channel`` for Google Chat and ``email`` for email since phase
        6 of the channels & identity unification. The default below is what an
        unnamed caller gets, not what the real path relies on.

        **Deviation from the pre-split behaviour, deliberate and narrow.**
        ``_route_new_thread`` used to gate Pass 2 on re-resolving the Pass-1
        agent in the *caller's* session: if that ``db.get`` came back empty it
        fell through to the catalog pass. That could only happen if the agent
        row were deleted in the microseconds between the worker thread loading
        it and the caller re-reading it, and the fall-through was incidental
        rather than designed — it would auto-install a catalog bundle for a
        sender whose agent had just been deleted. Pass 2 is now gated on Pass 1
        returning no agent at all; the vanished-agent race ends as a no-match
        instead. Nothing else about the ordering changes.

        **``include_catalog`` reaches Pass 1**, which it did not before, and
        that is load-bearing rather than tidy: Pass 1's single-candidate
        short-circuit turns on whether Pass 2 could offer an alternative, and
        with the catalog switched off it provably cannot. A Pass 1 that could
        not see the flag would classify where the real path short-circuits, and
        simulate would then diverge from the path it exists to reproduce.

        ``ballot`` is Pass 1's already-computed Pass-2 candidate set, carried
        across so the catalog is scanned **at most once per decision**. Plain
        data (see :class:`CatalogBallot`), and ``None`` on every branch where
        Pass 1 did not scan — in which case Pass 2 scans for itself exactly as
        it always has.

        **Identity is an outcome of Pass 1, and it is terminal.** When
        ``policy.allow_identity_routing`` is on, Pass 1's ballot also carries
        the people this sender may address, and a person winning it hands off
        to Stage 2 (:meth:`_route_identity`). Both of Stage 2's answers end the
        decision: an agent, returned with the :class:`IdentityGrant` that
        permits a session on it, or nothing, which is an ordinary ``no_match``.
        Neither falls through to Pass 2 — see the gate below for why, and
        :meth:`_route_installed` for how the two ballots compose.

        **``policy`` is required, and it is not the door.** It carries three
        things into the decision — the sender's agent scope, their pinned
        agent, and whether Pass 2 may run — each consumed below or in
        :meth:`_route_installed`. The scope is the one read **twice**, and
        deliberately: it narrows the Pass-1 ballot in
        ``ChannelCandidateProvider``, and it separately bars Pass 2 in
        :meth:`_catalog_may_run`, which is a product decision rather than a
        second application of the same filter — that method's docstring is
        where it is argued. What it does **not** do here is
        gate on ``is_available``. That term is the inbound pipeline's, checked
        in ``ChannelInboundService.process_inbound`` before routing is ever
        scheduled, and it produces a *reply* rather than a route. Two reasons
        it is not re-checked here, and the second is the one that decides it:
        this function has no way to express "declined" (its whole vocabulary is
        an agent id, a bundle id, or neither), and an admin running
        ``POST /admin/routing/simulate`` against a user whose channel is
        currently switched off is asking how the message *would* route once it

    ) -> bool:
        """May Pass 2 run at all? The conjunction of four unrelated switches.

        They are genuinely different things and are kept apart everywhere but
        here. ``include_catalog`` is the *admin's diagnostic* toggle on
        simulate — "would this have matched something they already have?" —
        and is ``True`` on every real inbound message.
        ``policy.allow_auto_install`` is the *channel's* configuration, an
        admin default a user cannot override, and it is what makes
        auto-installing a bundle for a whitelisted stranger something a server
        opts into rather than something Google Chat does implicitly.

        **The agent scope is the third term, and it is a decided product semantic
        rather than an implementation convenience.** Pass 2 does not
        run unless the resolved ``agent_scope`` is ``"all"``.

        ``agent_scope="none"`` or ``"list"`` with ``allow_auto_install=True`` is
        otherwise a dead configuration: Pass 2 installs a bundle whose agent is
        out of scope **by construction** — ``ChannelCandidateProvider._in_scope``
        admits an installed agent only under ``"all"``, or under ``"list"`` if
        the sender goes and adds it — so the first message installs and every
        later thread dead-ends on an agent that can never be a candidate again.

        The reasoning, stated here because a future reader will meet the term
        before they meet the argument: a sender who restricted their channel to
        specific agents has said *"nothing routes here but these"*. Performing
        an install and a binding attempt on a path that cannot succeed violates
        least-surprise and this feature's fail-closed ethos, and the one defence
        of the old behaviour — that the install is useful later, once the sender
        manually adds the new agent to their list — is speculative about an
        action nothing prompts them to take. So the restriction is read as the
        instruction it is.

        **A pin is the fourth term, and it is the one that is easy to lose.**
        :meth:`_route_pinned_agent` argues at length that a pinned channel
        never auto-installs — installing a bundle over an explicit instruction
        is the router overruling the person it routes for — and the pin
        short-circuit alone does *not* deliver that. Its two failure branches
        (the agent was deleted, the agent changed hands) return ``None``, which
        is indistinguishable at :meth:`decide` from "Pass 1 found nothing", so
        without this term the sender whose pinned agent vanished between the
        policy resolution and the background routing task would silently be
        auto-installed a catalog bundle and bound to it. That window is a task
        hop plus an LLM cascade wide, not a microsecond. The gate is written
        off ``pinned_agent_id`` — what the sender asked for — rather than off
        whether the pin resolved, because the sender's instruction stands
        whether or not the platform could honour it.

        One function because the conjunction is read in two places that must
        not disagree: here, deciding whether to run Pass 2 at all, and inside
        Pass 1, deciding whether the single-candidate short-circuit may skip
        the classifier. A Pass 1 that thought the catalog was live while
        ``decide`` knew it was not would classify where the real path routes
        directly, which is the divergence ``include_catalog``'s own reach into
        Pass 1 was added to prevent (see :meth:`decide`). The pin term is inert
        on that second reading — a pinned decision returns before the probe is
        reached — and is included anyway so the two readings stay one rule.

        **What the scope term does to that second reading, which is a real
        behaviour change and not a side effect.** On a scope-restricted channel
        the short-circuit now fires where it previously classified: a sender
        with exactly one in-scope eligible agent takes it directly, because
        this function answers ``False`` and :meth:`_catalog_ballot` returns
        ``scanned=False``, whose ``offers_an_alternative`` is ``False``. That is
        correct under the short-circuit's own governing rule — *sound only when
        there is no alternative to choose between* — and it is now **provably**
        so rather than approximately so: Pass 2 cannot run on this channel, so
        the choice space is one by construction, not one by an empty catalog
        that could fill up tomorrow. The scan is also skipped entirely, which
        removes a per-message catalog read that could never have changed the
        answer.

        **Public on purpose**, despite living on this class. Two other modules
        call it — ``channel_inbound_service`` for its four trace writes and its
        quoted-message authorship lookup, and
        ``routing_tuning_service`` for simulate's — so an underscore name here
        would be a private symbol that three modules depend on, and the next
        person to change its signature would grep only this file. That is §11a
        Rule 2 instance 4 exactly: a signature change landing without its call
        sites, raising ``TypeError`` at the call site *before* the guarded
        callee is entered, and breaking channel routing outright.

        Both routing passes end in a synchronous LLM HTTP call (and the
        provider manager cascades through providers sequentially). This
        coroutine runs on the main loop, so calling them inline would block
        the whole process — externally triggerable, since any whitelisted
        sender can open a new thread.

        ``fn`` must NOT close over the caller's DB session: ``run_sync`` cannot
        interrupt a running thread, so a cancelled task would close the session
        out from under a mid-query worker. The thread targets below each open
        their own session and return plain ids (the pattern at
        ``message_service.py`` ``_run_in_thread``).

        Capacity note: anyio's default thread limiter is 40. With a webhook
        rate limit of 120/min per token, a burst of new threads queues here
        rather than growing unbounded — queueing is the intended degradation,
        and it is bounded by the limiter rather than by memory.

        **Also the offload for ``RoutingTraceService.persist``**, which the
        callers use it for. ``persist`` is synchronous and does an
        INSERT+COMMIT through a pooled connection of its own; called inline from
        a coroutine it performs that round trip **on the event loop**, so every
        other request and stream in the process waits on it — and it happens up
        to four times per inbound message, on a path any whitelisted sender can
        trigger. That is §11a Rule 2 arriving as latency rather than as an
        exception: the diagnostic degrading the pipeline it exists to explain.

        Note the second pooled connection is not what the offload avoids — a
        worker thread takes one too. It is the *loop* that stops waiting.

        Note ``*args`` is **positional only** — there is no ``**kwargs``,
        deliberately, because ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``'s own keywords
        (``limiter``, ``abandon_on_cancel``) would be ambiguous with the
        callee's. A call that needs keywords wraps them itself:

        ``policy`` is positional and third rather than tacked on the end with a

        **Order of the model-free answers:** the pin, then (once the ballot
        exists and is non-empty) the quoted-reply preference
        (:meth:`_route_quoted_reply`), then the single-candidate probe. A pin is
        the sender's standing instruction and outranks a quote; a quote points
        at one agent on the ballot, so there is nothing for the probe to weigh
        it against.

        Returns ``(agent, ballot, identity)``. The ballot is Pass 2's candidate
        set when the single-candidate probe below computed one, and ``None``
        otherwise; the caller is responsible for recording it exactly once (see
        :class:`CatalogBallot`). ``identity`` is set only when the winning
        candidate named a *person* — see :meth:`_route_identity`.

        **The pin is answered before anything else runs** — see
        :meth:`_route_pinned_agent` for why it outranks both short-circuits and
        Pass 2, and what that costs. Everything below this paragraph describes
        the unpinned path, which is every sender who has not made that choice.

        **The candidate set is constructed, not filtered.** This used to call
        ``AppMCPRoutingService.route_message``, whose candidates answer *"what
        can this user address through the App MCP server"* — a set that both
        omitted the sender's own standalone agents (no auto-route is ever
        created for one) and included other people's agents by way of admin
        routes and identity contacts. Two filters then tried to correct that
        subtractively, *downstream of the classifier*, which is how the
        reported incident became a total failure rather than a near miss: the
        LLM spent the decision on an identity route, the filter rejected it
        afterwards, and nothing re-classified over the survivors.
        ``ChannelCandidateProvider`` builds the right set instead — see its
        module docstring, and
        ``docs/application/server_channels/server_channels.md``.

        **Identities are a second provider, composed — not the old branch
        restored.** ``IdentityCandidateProvider.build`` appends one candidate
        per *person* this sender may address, and only when
        ``policy.allow_identity_routing`` says so. Read the difference
        carefully, because the two look alike from a distance and one of them
        was an incident: the deleted branch inherited *somebody else's ballot*
        — ``AppAgentRouteService.get_effective_routes_for_user`` — complete with
        three App MCP enablement toggles, and then tried to reject the parts it
        did not want downstream of the classifier. This adds a set built for
        this surface, gated on this sender's own consent, *before* the
        classifier, and a winner from it goes to Stage 2 rather than to a
        rejection. Providers compose; surfaces do not borrow (master plan §3.1).
        ``SKIP_IDENTITY_ROUTE`` still has no producer here — it is the old
        branch's rejection reason, and rows written before the split still
        carry it, so the admin UI goes on rendering it.

        Two further consequences worth stating, because both are deliberate:

        - **No route-supplied ``session_mode``.** Nothing on the channel path
          ever read it; ``ChannelIngestionService`` opens ``mode="conversation"``
          sessions by default, which is what those sessions already were.
        - **A ``only_one`` short-circuit, but a conditional one.** A ballot with
          exactly one eligible candidate routes to it without asking a model —
          *provided Pass 2 has nothing to offer this sender*. The governing
          principle is one line, and it is what the unconditional forms of this
          get wrong in both directions:

              **A short-circuit is sound only when there is no alternative to
              choose between.**

          The hazard in the *old* ``only_one`` — the one this pass ran before
          the scope split — was never the short-circuit. It was the set it ran
          over: the lone candidate came from
          ``AppAgentRouteService.get_effective_routes_for_user`` and could
          perfectly well be a foreign agent or an identity contact route, so
          "route to it, no questions asked" could hand an external sender a
          session inside somebody else's workspace. Eliminating that class is
          exactly what ``ChannelCandidateProvider`` did. Over the corrected set
          the short-circuit is safer than it has ever been: the one candidate is
          either one of the sender's own agents or a person this sender
          consented to address, by construction, and ineligible candidates are
          still filtered *before* the classifier rather than after it.

          **A lone identity candidate short-circuits too, and that branch is
          the HR story's simplest shape rather than a corner case.** A sender
          who owns no agents and can reach exactly one identity owner produces
          a one-candidate ballot, and on a server with an empty auto-install
          list it takes this path with no classifier call at all. So
          :meth:`_route_only_candidate` runs Stage 2 as well — the difference
          between the two branches is only whether a model was asked *which*
          candidate, never what happens to the one that wins.

          What is genuinely load-bearing is the Pass-2 condition, and the
          sharpened version of the objection is decisive: a newly
          auto-registered sender owns **zero** agents, and the moment Pass 2
          onboards them they own **exactly one**. "Exactly one eligible agent"
          is therefore not an edge case — it is the immediate post-onboarding
          state of every user auto-install has ever served, and under an
          unconditional short-circuit the onboarding message would be the last
          one that could ever reach the catalog. Pass 2's candidates are part of
          the choice space, so the probe below asks whether that space is bigger
          than one before deciding it can be skipped.

          **The probe is confined to the branch that can use it.** Zero eligible
          candidates falls straight through to Pass 2 (unchanged); two or more
          classify regardless, because the choice space is already bigger than
          one and Pass-2 availability cannot change the answer. Only the
          exactly-one branch scans. That confinement is a cost decision as much
          as a tidiness one: an unconfined probe would put a
          ``CatalogService.user_can_install`` round per bundle in front of
          *every* inbound message on an externally triggerable endpoint,
          including the common case where Pass 1 matches and Pass 2 never runs
          today.

          What it costs — the note this replaces claimed two costs, and both
          described a state that no longer exists. The provider cascade is no
          longer paid on every message (a single-candidate sender with an empty
          catalog now pays none), and a single-agent sender's off-topic message
          can no longer be quietly redirected into a catalog install, because
          with an empty catalog there is no install to redirect it to.

          What it does still cost, stated because :meth:`_catalog_may_run` now
          has more ways to answer ``False``: whenever Pass 2 cannot run **as a
          matter of policy** — the channel's ``allow_auto_install`` is off, or
          its agent scope is restricted — a single-candidate sender's off-topic
          message routes to that sole agent without the classifier being given
          the chance to answer *"none of mine"*. That is the short-circuit's own
          rule applied honestly rather than a regression: there is genuinely no
          alternative to choose between, because the only other pass is barred.
          It is worth knowing it is what a scope restriction buys.

        The ``agent.owner_id != user.id`` guard below is a defence-in-depth
        postcondition on the **non-identity** path, and on that path it remains
        unreachable by construction: every candidate the channel provider
        builds came out of a ``WHERE owner_id = :user_id``. It is the same
        invariant ``ChannelIngestionService.assert_access`` asserts for
        ``channel_caller`` sessions, and a cheap assertion is worth more than
        the two lines it costs on a path that hands an external sender a
        session inside a workspace.

        **The identity path is foreign by design, and is dispatched before
        that guard is reached** — in both the classifier branch and
        :meth:`_route_only_candidate`. This is not the guard being relaxed: an
        identity-selected agent is permitted precisely because Stage 2 produced
        an :class:`IdentityGrant` naming the binding and assignment behind it,
        which ``assert_access`` then re-reads and re-verifies before any session
        opens. What the guard forbids — a foreign agent with *nothing*
        authorising it — is still forbidden, and :meth:`_route_identity` adds
        its own postcondition in the same shape (the agent must belong to the
        identity owner Stage 1 chose).

        """The sender pinned an agent to this channel. Use it, ask nothing.

        **Ordering, which is the whole design of this method.** It runs before
        the candidate provider, before the ``only_one`` short-circuit and
        before Pass 2, and each of those three is a separate decision:

        - **Before the provider.** A pin has already answered the question the
          ballot exists to ask. Building one anyway would cost a query and fill
          the trace with candidates that were never in contention, and it could
          not change the answer — a trace listing four agents under
          ``match_method=pinned`` invites the reader to wonder which of them
          lost, when none of them ran.
        - **Before ``only_one``.** The two look alike from outside (both route
          without a model) and mean opposite things. ``only_one`` is an
          inference from a choice space that happens to hold one thing; a pin
          is an instruction that holds however many agents the sender owns. If
          they could ever disagree the pin must win, and it does — by never
          reaching that branch.
        - **Before Pass 2.** Auto-install exists to onboard a sender who owns
          nothing that matches. A sender who pinned an agent has said where
          their messages go, and installing a catalog bundle over that would be
          the router overruling the person it is routing for. So a pinned
          channel never auto-installs, including for a message the pinned agent
          is a poor fit for — "everything I send here goes to this one" is what
          the pin means, and a router that quietly made exceptions to it would
          be worse than one that never offered it.

        **The scope is deliberately not consulted.** A pin can name an agent
        that the sender's own ``agent_scope`` would exclude, and it still wins.
        Both settings come from the same person on the same screen, and the pin
        is the more specific of the two statements; a pin that lost to its
        neighbour on the same card would be a self-contradiction with nothing
        to show the sender why. It costs nothing in reach: the pin is
        ownership-checked twice (see below), so the widest thing it can do is
        route the sender to an agent they own.

        **It does not skip the trace**, which is the rule this codebase has
        already had to fix once. A pinned decision records the match method,
        the winning candidate and the terminal outcome (settled by the caller),
        so a reader can tell "the classifier never ran because there was a pin"
        from "the classifier ran and chose this". The candidate row is recorded
        as **eligible**, unlike the availability-only Pass-2 rows: it was the
        ballot, in full, and it won — ``eligible=True`` feeds the "chosen from
        N eligible candidates" arithmetic and here N genuinely is one.

        **Ownership is re-checked, though it was already checked.**
        ``ChannelPolicyService._owned_pin`` nulls a pin whose agent the sender
        no longer owns, so this guard is unreachable through that path — the
        same status as the ``owner_id`` guard in :meth:`_route_installed`, and
        kept for the same reason: this hands an external sender a session
        inside a workspace, and two lines of assertion is a cheap price for the
        one that is not reachable *yet*. Unlike that guard, this one protects
        an id that came in as **data on a settings row** rather than out of a
        ``WHERE owner_id = :user_id``, so the property it asserts is one hop
        further from where it is established.

        ``quoted_agent_id`` names the agent whose channel turn wrote the quoted
        message. The caller read it from the channel's delivery ledger; the
        quoted *text* plays no part in it. It is a fact about the conversation,
        not a permission, so it may only **narrow** the ballot this pass built
        under the sender's policy and never add to it.

        Returns ``None`` when the preference does not apply, and Pass 1 carries
        on exactly as it would have: the single-candidate probe, then the
        classifier with the quote as context. A tuple is terminal for Pass 1,
        in the shape :meth:`_route_only_candidate` returns.

        Two arms:

        - **Owned.** The quoted agent is one of the sender's own candidates. It
          is re-loaded and re-checked as the single-candidate branch does
          (:meth:`_reload_own_agent`), so a concurrent delete ends as a
          recorded ``no_match``, and Pass 2 may still run after it.
        - **Identity.** The agent belongs to somebody whose ``identity:``
          candidate is on this ballot — so the sender's identity consent is on
          and that person is addressable — and it is one of that person's
          bindings the sender can reach
          (:meth:`IdentityRoutingService.agent_reachable`). Stage 2 then runs
          with the agent as its preference and re-reads the bindings itself,
          and ``assert_access`` re-verifies the grant before any session opens.
          If Stage 2's own read disagrees (a binding switched off in between),
          it selects among the reachable bindings as usual, and the decision's
          ``match_method`` reads whatever Stage 2 last recorded: ``only_one``
          from its single-binding shortcut, or still ``quoted_reply`` after a
          classification (which records none). The reachability verdict tells
          the latter apart by comparing ``selected_agent_id`` with
          ``quoted_agent_id``.

        **A miss records nothing.** An owned agent missing from the ballot was
        excluded by scope or eligibility, and the skip that explains it is
        already on the trace. A foreign agent without an identity candidate
        leaves no candidate or skip rows, which keeps the consent-off inversion
        :meth:`_route_installed` describes. (The trace still stores
        ``quoted_agent_id``: the ledger's answer to who wrote the quoted
        message, not a list of the people this sender could reach.)

        between — see :meth:`_route_installed`'s docstring for why that
        condition and not "exactly one candidate" alone.

        **It does not skip the trace.** The candidate rows and every skipped row
        with its reason were already written by
        ``ChannelCandidateProvider.build`` before this is called; what is added
        here is ``match_method="only_one"``, so a reader can tell that the
        classifier never ran rather than ran and agreed. A fast path that went
        quiet would take the diagnosis away precisely when routing was easy,
        which is the trace an admin least expects to be missing.

        **The sole candidate can be an identity, and this is not the rare
        shape.** A sender who owns no agents and can reach exactly one identity
        owner produces a one-candidate ballot, and with an empty auto-install
        list the probe short-circuits here without the classifier ever running
        — which is the HR story at its simplest. So Stage 2 is dispatched from
        here as well as from the classifier branch, over the raw ``message``:
        no classifier ran, so there is no transformed message to prefer.

        Re-loads the agent by id in this session rather than trusting the
        candidate: the ballot is a projection built moments ago, and this is the
        same ``db.get`` the classifier branch does. The two guards
        (:meth:`_reload_own_agent`) are the same two it applies, for the same
        reasons — a concurrent delete is genuinely reachable, and the ownership
        check is defence in depth against a candidate provider that stopped
        scoping. Both are on the **non-identity** path only; the identity
        dispatch above them carries its own postcondition

        preferred agent exactly as to a classified one.

        Always returns an :class:`IdentitySelection`, because "the sender
        addressed a person" is true of every branch here and is what stops
        ``decide`` reaching for Pass 2. The ``Agent`` beside it is ``None``
        whenever Stage 2 selected nothing, which is an ordinary ``no_match``
        for the whole decision rather than an error: the sender gets the
        existing "couldn't find an agent" reply, and auto-installing a catalog
        bundle for somebody who asked to speak to a colleague is not a better
        answer.

        **Two stages, and the second one does not recurse.** Stage 2 chooses
        among *agents* — an identity's bindings name agents, never further
        identities — so there is no depth to count and no cycle to guard
        (master plan §2.10). A counter here would imply chains are supported.

        **Written under its own stage.** ``stage_scope`` rather than
        ``begin_stage``: this is a handoff that returns, and a latched stage
        would file everything recorded afterwards — including this method's own
        rejections, which are Pass-1 facts — under ``identity_stage2``. Same
        call shape the App MCP path uses, for the same reason its comment gives.

        **Total, like Pass 1's own catch-all.** Stage 2 ends in a blocking LLM
        call whenever the caller can reach two or more of the owner's agents,
        so it has exactly the outage exposure ``_route_installed`` wraps its
        candidate build and classification in — and this method is reached from
        the classifier branch, which is *outside* that try. An outage here is
        recorded on the trace and declines; it does not 500 an externally
        triggerable webhook.

        **Its postcondition is the identity twin of the ownership guard.** A
        channel session may run on a foreign agent only when a grant names the
        binding behind it, so the agent Stage 2 returns must belong to the
        person Stage 1 chose. ``IdentityService`` enforces that on write and
        ``ChannelIngestionService.assert_access`` re-reads it before any session
        opens; this is the middle check, and it is what keeps
        :class:`RoutingDecisionResult`'s ``agent_id`` and ``identity_grant``
        describing the same person.

        finalists cannot explain the failure that actually bites, which on this
        pass is *"why was this user never offered anything?"*.

        ``availability_only`` is for the branch where Pass 1 short-circuited or
        matched and Pass 2 therefore never classified. It addresses the
        ``pass_2`` stage explicitly — these are Pass 2's candidates even though
        Pass 1's capture is the one open — and stamps
        :data:`CATALOG_AVAILABILITY_ONLY_NOTE`, without which a stage carrying
        candidate rows and no verdict is indistinguishable from a Pass 2 that
        ran and found nothing.

        On that branch a scan that found **nothing at all** writes no stage.
        Every skip is still recorded exactly once — there are none — and the
        alternative is a ``pass_2`` heading with a note under it and no rows, on
        every message from every sender on a server with an empty auto-install

        nothing to look at" is noise where the note's whole job is to explain
        rows that *are* there.

        **And on that branch the surviving candidates are recorded as skipped,
        not eligible.** They passed every gate, but no classifier was ever given
        them, and ``eligible=True`` is not a description of a bundle — it is an
        input to arithmetic the diagnostic surface performs. Marked eligible
        they would join the "chosen from N eligible candidates" the verdict
        prints, the ``candidate_count`` the admin list shows, the near-miss

        eligible candidate and the classifier did not pick it"* about a

        A no-op unless one of the three policy terms in :meth:`_catalog_may_run`
        is what stops it, so the call site stays one unconditional line and
        every condition lives with the reason it belongs to.

        **One note per cause, and the causes must stay distinguishable.** The
        three are fixed on different screens — the sender's own pin, the agent
        scope, and the admin's ``allow_auto_install`` — so a shared "policy
        said no" would be a diagnosis that names no control. Checked
        narrowest-first: a pin answers the routing question outright, an agent
        scope narrows this channel for this sender, and ``allow_auto_install``
        is the channel-wide admin default underneath both.

        Note that only the first and last of those have a single owner. The
        agent scope **inherits**, so it is the sender's own setting or the
        channel's admin default depending on whether a
        ``channel_user_setting`` row says so, and this module cannot tell:
        ``ResolvedChannelPolicy`` deliberately carries no provenance. Hence
        :data:`PASS_2_SCOPE_RESTRICTED_NOTE` states the fact without claiming
        an owner, and the reachability verdict — which has a session and calls
        ``ChannelPolicyService.describe`` — is where the screen gets named.

        Scope is reported ahead of ``allow_auto_install`` when both bar the
        pass, and that order is the diagnosis rather than a coin toss. A
        restricted scope invalidates the *other* remedy too: under it, giving
        this sender a new agent with a trigger prompt does not make them
        routable either, because the new agent would be out of scope as well.
        Naming the auto-install switch first would send the reader to fix one
        thing and come back to a channel that still routes nothing.

        **Silent when Pass 1 already recorded an error.** On that branch the
        pass blew up before it decided anything, and the truthful answer to
        "why did Pass 2 not run" is "Pass 1 failed first" — stamping a policy
        note over it would assert a reason that was never reached. The error is
        the story; this note would be a second, quieter claim competing with it.

        **Why this writes a stage for a pass that never ran**, which
        :meth:`_record_catalog_ballot` refuses to do a few lines up and which
        ``routing_trace``'s docstring makes a rule of ("a pass that ran always
        leaves a stage"). The refusal there is about *noise*: an empty
        ``pass_2`` heading on every message from every sender on a server with
        an empty auto-install list, saying only that there was nothing to look
        at. This one is the opposite — it is written only when Pass 1 found
        nothing *and* this sender's own policy is what stopped the catalog,
        which is precisely the trace somebody is reading to find out why they
        were never offered anything, and the answer is not visible anywhere
        else on the row. The stage is the finding, not a heading over one.

        **Each note is written alongside a code**, and the pair is the whole
        arrangement. With ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` off the note is
        still withheld — ``reason`` is not on ``routing_trace``'s allowlist and
        should not be, since it is the field the classifier's own prose lands
        in — but ``not_run_code`` is, so the fact the note carries survives the
        gate while the sentence does not. That fact is precisely *which switch
        to go and look at*: without it this stage read, gate closed,
        indistinguishable from a Pass 2 that ran over an empty catalog.

        The code is assigned **inside this same if/elif chain**, never
        recomputed from ``policy`` afterwards. The narrowest-first ordering
        above is the diagnosis, and a second independent pass over the same
        three terms is how a code ends up naming a different control from the
        sentence beside it.
