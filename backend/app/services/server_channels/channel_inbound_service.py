"""The inbound pipeline: webhook request → agent session.

This module is the security boundary of the feature. The webhook it serves is
platform-unauthenticated by design — anyone on the internet can POST to it —
so the ordering below is load-bearing, not stylistic:

    1. resolve channel      unknown/disabled token → 404, no detail, no oracle
    2. VERIFY (fail closed) adapter proves the platform sent this; nothing
                            above this line has parsed or trusted the payload
    3. dedup                webhook redelivery must not double-send
    4. whitelist            NULL/empty denies everyone; "*" is the only
                            blanket allow
    5. resolve user         auto-register only if the channel opted in
    6. channel policy       admin kill switch AND access grant AND the user's
                            own toggle; resolved once, here, and carried into
                            routing as plain data
    6.5 attachments         the sender's files become FileUpload rows owned by
                            THEM. Below every gate above on purpose: nothing
                            is fetched, stored, or charged to a quota before
                            the sender is admitted
    7. binding / routing    session work, off the request path

Steps 1–6 are cheap and run inline. Everything from 7 on can be slow (an LLM
routing call, an install, an environment build), so it runs as a background
task and the webhook answers immediately. The real reply arrives
asynchronously through ``ChannelOutboundService``.

What that immediate answer *is* depends on the transport. A **decline** is
always the sync response: it needs no outbound credential, which is what lets
a channel refuse a sender before setup is finished. An **accepted** message
acks with an empty body on a transport that can run a status notice, and the
background task posts the narration itself — see ``REPLY_WORKING`` and the
notice helpers on ``ChannelOutboundService``. The reason is not stylistic:
Google Chat creates the synchronous message but never tells us its id, so a
notice answered inline can be neither rewritten as the work advances nor
removed when the answer lands, which is the whole behaviour. Transports
without that capability keep the sync acknowledgement they always had.

The list splits at the chokepoint, and so does the code. ``handle_inbound``
owns steps 1–2 — the parts that are webhook-shaped, because only a webhook has
a token to resolve and a request to verify. ``process_inbound`` owns everything
from there and is transport-agnostic: a polled transport authenticates inside
its own ``poll`` (see ``PolledChannelTransport.poll``, which restates step 2's
promise for a pull driver) and enters the pipeline at the second method. What
does **not** change is the ordering below the split, or the rule that nothing
under it re-checks the sender.

**Step 6 gates every path below it, not only new threads.** A sender whose
access was revoked — the admin disabled the channel, withdrew their grant, or
they switched the channel off themselves — is declined on their *existing*
thread too. An already-bound conversation that keeps answering after access is
taken away is a security surprise, and ``ServerChannel.enabled`` is documented
as an absolute kill switch, which it would not be if the threads it had already
opened went on working. The decline uses the whitelist miss's reply verbatim;
see ``REPLY_DENIED``.

Trust model: the sender's email comes from a payload the adapter verified was
signed by the platform. That is the same trust tier the email integration
extends to IMAP, and it is what lets a whitelisted address be treated as an
identity. Sessions are owned by the sender's own platform user, so the blast
radius of a whitelist mistake is one empty auto-created account.

**One deliberate exception to that last sentence, since Phase 3 of
``docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/``: identity routing.** When a
sender has switched ``allow_identity_routing`` on and addresses a person who
shared an identity with them, routing may select *that person's* agent, and the
session is then owned by the identity owner rather than by the sender — it is
their agent, their space, their credentials, and their session list. It is
opt-in on both sides (the owner shares the identity and assigns it; the sender
turns identity routing on for the channel and keeps the per-person toggle), and
every message re-verifies the grant, so revocation bites immediately rather than
at the next thread. What does **not** change is the thread binding: it stays the
sender's, because "this thread belongs to this person" is what stops one member
of a group space from posting into another's conversation.

    that renders it to a person.

    **An unrecognised code falls back to a generic sentence, never to the code
    itself.** This surface is a *sender's* transcript on an unauthenticated
    ingress, and a raw token is an internal identifier leaking outward — it
    tells an external party nothing they can act on while naming a piece of

    split ``_reply`` and ``_log_detail`` already draw in this file.

        """The pipeline from step 3 down — everything after authentication.

        Split out of ``handle_inbound`` because the *chokepoint* moved, not the
        pipeline. A webhook transport authenticates in ``verify_inbound`` and
        arrives here; a polled transport authenticates inside ``poll``, against
        a source whose strength it documents, and arrives here too. Nothing
        from here down knows or cares which door the message came through, and
        the module docstring's ordering is load-bearing for both.

        **The caller is the authentication chokepoint.** Nothing below
        re-verifies the sender — ``inbound.sender_email`` is treated as the
        sender's identity from the first line, and it is what the whitelist,
        user resolution, auto-registration and identity routing all key on. A
        caller that reaches this method with an ``inbound`` it did not
        authenticate has voided the promise the whole module rests on.

        Returns the body the caller answers with. For a webhook that is the
        sync HTTP response. For a polled transport it is **inert**:
        ``PolledChannelTransport`` does not override ``build_sync_response``
        and the base default returns ``{}``, so every denial below —
        ``REPLY_DENIED`` and the rest — collapses to
        the same empty body as the branches that ack in silence.

        Every sync response that *is* rendered carries the thread the message
        arrived on. Google Chat posts an unthreaded one as a new top-level
        message in the space, so a denial that omitted it answered somewhere
        other than the conversation it was declining.

        That is the decided behaviour, not a gap left open. A polled transport
        has no sync-reply surface, and mailing declines back down the pull
        channel would be both a probing oracle (an unlisted sender learns which
        addresses the platform knows) and a spam amplifier (every unsolicited
        message earns a reply to an address the sender chose).

        Silent to the *sender*; never to the *operator*. Every denial branch
        writes a ``ChannelDebugBuffer`` record with its own summary and stage
        before returning, and that feed — not the response body — is where an
        admin diagnoses a channel that is dropping messages.

        # time, so a Chat retry never reaches this line twice. On an ALREADY
        # BOUND thread the only dedup is ``last_external_message_id``, and that
        # is stamped after a successful ingest, inside the background task
        # (see ``_continue_thread``) — deliberately, so a redelivery of a
        # message we failed to process stays a recovery opportunity. A retry
        # therefore does reach this line twice, and the duplicate *storage*
        # that would follow is closed inside ``materialize`` instead of by
        # narrowing the dedup: it keys on
        # ``(binding, external_message_id, position)`` and hands back the rows
        # the earlier delivery already wrote, so the sender's quota is charged
        # once however many times Google retries. Moving the stamp above this
        # call would have been the other way to close it, and it is the wrong
        # one — it marks a half-ingested message as seen and strands it. The
        # text-level double delivery is pre-existing and unchanged.
        #
        # ``owner_id`` is the **sender**, never the session owner — on an
        # identity-routed thread those differ, and owning the file as the
        # sender is what keeps provenance honest and charges the right person's

        The decision itself — Pass 1 over the sender's installed agents, then
        Pass 2 over the auto-install catalog — lives in
        :meth:`ChannelRoutingService.decide` and has no effects of its own. What
        remains here is everything that *does* have effects: the thread binding,
        the session ingest, the install-and-park, the outbound reply, the debug
        feed entry, and the durable trace write.

        That split is what makes ``POST /admin/routing/simulate`` safe by
        construction: simulate calls ``decide`` and stops, so there is no
        ``simulate`` flag in this method to get a branch wrong about.

        ``policy`` is the resolution ``process_inbound`` already made — the same
        one its decline gate consulted — carried in rather than resolved again
        here. It is a frozen dataclass of scalars, so it crosses into this
        background task the way ids and text do, and this method's
        freshly-opened session is never asked to re-derive an inherit rule.

        ``origin`` travels onto the trace unchanged, carried in for the same
        reason ``policy`` is: it is a plain string resolved from the adapter
        that accepted the message, and re-deriving it from the reloaded channel
        row would make it a fact about the row's current state instead.

        **``classification_text`` and ``text`` are two parameters on purpose.**
        ``decide()`` gets the first; everything that persists — the ingest, the
        park — gets the second. Today they hold the same string on every
        ordinary message, and the temptation to "tidy" them back into one is
        exactly what this docstring exists to refuse: an attachment-only
        message has no words for the router, so its classification text is
        derived from the accepted filenames (plan §5.4) while its stored
        content stays what the sender actually sent. ``None`` means "they are
        the same", which keeps every existing caller honest without a second
        argument.

        ``file_ids`` are the sender's attachments, materialised at step 6.5 and
        carried down whichever branch this message takes — ingested with it,
        parked with it behind an auto-install, or handed to the winner of a
        binding race along with the text.

        **The clarification round-trip.** Where this transport can follow a
        question up (``notice_supported``) and guidance is on, ``decide`` may
        answer ``clarify``: the question is stored
        (``ChannelRoutingClarificationService.ask``) with this message and
        settled into the notice. When the sender answers, step 7.5 calls this
        again for the **stored** message with ``chosen_ref_id`` (the option
        they picked, which ``decide`` only takes if policy still admits it) and
        ``answered_by_external_message_id`` (the answer's own id). That id is
        written as an ingest receipt on the binding this creates, so a
        redelivered answer is never ingested.

        **Returns whether a message was actually created**, and that return
        value is not decoration. Callers used to read "did an exception escape
        this call" as "was the message delivered", which is a different
        question and was wrong in exactly the case that matters: a soft
        ``action="error"`` from the ingestion service returned normally, the
        caller stamped ``binding.last_external_message_id`` as though the
        message had landed, and the sender's message was lost permanently —
        the stamp dedups every redelivery of it from then on.
        ``_ingest`` now raises ``ChannelIngestProducedNoMessage`` for that
        family, and this returns ``False`` for it, so a caller can gate on the
        answer rather than on the absence of a symptom.

        Without this, a Pass 1 ingest failure would leave an ``active`` binding
        with no session and no error — a state the self-heal path (which only
        triggers on ``failed``) never cleans up.

        ``identity_grant`` is forwarded verbatim and defaults to ``None``: only
        the first message of a freshly-routed thread has a routing decision
        behind it. Every later message reconstructs its own grant from the
        session row (see :meth:`_ingest`), because a stale claim carried across
        turns is exactly what re-verification exists to prevent.

        ``policy`` is required, not defaulted: it is the sender's reading for
        *this* message and there is no safe value to invent for a caller that
        forgot it — a permissive default would silently re-open identity
        routing for a person who has switched it off.

        ``file_ids`` are forwarded verbatim. A failure to copy them into the
        agent's container surfaces as the ``MessageServiceError`` the broad
        handler below already turns into a failed binding and the generic
        setup-failed reply, which self-heals on the next message — the same
        disposition every other ingest failure gets.

        ``redelivered_file_ids`` is forwarded verbatim too; see
        :meth:`_ingest`.

        never find the pending binding without it and be parked for the agent.

        ``file_ids`` are parked with the text (§3.2). Ids only, never bytes:

        it is the caller's failure handler that has to write the last word: an
        adopted notice must be settled *through the binding*, so the id is
        released and the pending-flush loop cannot come back minutes later and

        **Entries are read defensively, not by index.** ``file_ids`` is a key
        this feature added to a JSON column that already had rows in it, so a
        binding parked before the deploy drains after it with no such key —
        hence ``entry.get("file_ids") or []`` and never ``entry["file_ids"]``,
        which would raise a ``KeyError`` and lose a real message. The ids are
        parsed with the same posture; see ``_parse_parked_file_ids``. They are
        then filtered against the rows that still exist
        (``_surviving_parked_file_ids``), because a binding stuck past the 24h
        temp-file GC would otherwise lose its **text** as well as its files —
        the attach path refuses the whole message when a single id no longer
        resolves.

        Each entry is removed only AFTER its ingest succeeds, and the removal
        is committed immediately — so a crash mid-drain re-delivers at most the
        one in flight, and a failure leaves the rest parked rather than losing
        them. Stops on the first failure: the messages are a conversation, and
        replaying later ones out of order past a gap would be worse than
        waiting.

        **Two kinds of failure, two dispositions.** Keeping the messages parked
        is the right answer only for a failure a later attempt might not hit.
        ``_ingest`` also raises ``ChannelDecline`` for declines that
        will recur identically on every retry — the sender's
        ``allow_identity_routing`` consent being off (re-read per message from
        ``policy``), ``assert_access`` refusing a revoked or invalid identity
        grant, and the ``user.id != binding.user_id`` invariant guard. Retrying
        one of those forever would wedge the thread until the parked-message
        cap is hit, sending the person a setup-failed notice each time and
        never arming the ``failed`` self-heal that is the actual recovery. So a
        deterministic decline fails the binding instead; see the handler.

        The classifier gates on ``ChannelDecline`` and not on
        ``PermissionError``, deliberately: ``PermissionError`` is an
        ``OSError``, so the first real I/O under ``_ingest`` would start
        raising the "will never succeed" marker for failures that are merely
        transient — and the disposition for those is the opposite one. Every
        decline path below this method raises the narrower type (see its own
        docstring); the broad ``except`` further down still catches anything
        that does not.

        **This is pre-emptive, not a live bug fix.** Today identity-routed
        messages and parked messages are disjoint: parking requires binding
        status ``pending_install``, which only routing Pass 2 (auto-install)
        creates, and Pass 2 is barred on the identity branch — so no identity
        message can currently reach this drain. The invariant guard is likewise
        unreachable from here (every caller loads ``db.get(User,
        binding.user_id)``). What this removes is a wedge that any later phase
        making an identity message parkable would otherwise discover in
        production, where the symptom — a thread answering nothing, forever,
        with no failed binding to explain it — is expensive to diagnose.

        """Hand the message to the canonical ingestion service.

        The session is resumed by id when the binding already has one, and
        created otherwise. ``session_id`` is NULL both before the first message
        and after the session was deleted (the SET NULL cascade), so one branch
        covers first contact and recovery alike.

        ``sender_external_id`` is the platform-native id captured at the webhook
        (``google_chat:users/123``). It is metadata only — the authoritative
        identity is ``user.id`` — so when it is unavailable (a resume, or a
        parked message from before this field was recorded) the constructor
        falls back to the platform user id.

        **``user`` is always the binding's user — and this method now enforces
        that rather than merely asserting it.** Every caller already satisfies
        it (``_route_new_thread`` passes the sender it just bound;
        ``_continue_thread``, ``_handle_lost_race`` and the drain paths all
        load ``db.get(User, binding.user_id)``), but "every caller today" is
        not something a downstream guard can rest on, and Phase 4 adds a second
        poller into these helpers. The check at the top of the body makes
        ``sender.platform_user_id == binding.user_id`` true by construction.

        What that buys, precisely: it protects the **unchanged, non-identity**
        arm of ``ChannelIngestionService._verify_resume_sender``
        (``existing.user_id == sender.platform_user_id``). The binding pins
        ``session_id`` and the sender is the binding's user, so an ordinary
        channel session can only ever be resumed by the person the thread
        belongs to. It is **not** what makes that method's identity exception
        safe: that arm compares ``existing.identity_caller_id`` against the
        sender on the session row itself, and refuses a deliberately
        mismatched ``(binding, user)`` pair without any help from here. And
        neither arm is the authorization — ``assert_access`` runs first, on
        every message, and re-reads the whole grant.

        **Identity: the session may be owned by someone other than the
        sender.** Two sources, never mixed:

        - *First message of a routed thread* — ``identity_grant`` is the claim
          Stage 2 produced (plan §2.3). The identity ids are stamped onto the
          new session, and ``session.user_id`` becomes the identity owner.
        - *Every later message* — the claim is rebuilt from the session row
          itself, which carries all three ids. Rebuilding rather than caching
          is the point: ``assert_access`` re-reads and re-verifies all six
          conditions on **every** message, so an owner who revokes mid-thread
          is honored on the next turn rather than at the next thread. That
          extends Phase 2's decided semantic — a revoked sender is declined on
          an existing thread exactly as on a new one — and, like it, the
          decline is detail-free: the ``ChannelDecline`` is caught by
          ``_ingest_or_fail``, which sends the same generic reply every other
          failure gets.

        **The sender's own consent is re-read on every message too**, from
        ``policy`` — which is this message's single reading of their channel
        settings, carried in from the webhook or made fresh by the scheduler
        drain, never both. Turning ``allow_identity_routing`` off (or resetting
        the channel, which drops the row and returns the column to its ``false``
        default) therefore stops the *existing* identity thread on its next
        message, not only the next new one. A consent switch that could not be
        withdrawn on the very conversation it authorized would be no consent at
        all; and this is the same semantic already decided for a revoked grant,
        applied to the other side of the same permission. An ordinary channel
        thread has no grant, so it never consults the flag.

        ``integration_type`` stays ``channel_<type>`` on the identity path.
        ``ChannelOutboundService._resolve_channel_session`` gates on that
        prefix, so a session stamped ``identity_mcp`` here would route
        correctly, run correctly, and never deliver a reply.

        **``file_ids`` and the one non-default ``uploader_user_id`` on the
        platform.** The sender's attachments are owned by the *sender*, while
        an identity-routed session is owned by someone else — so the ownership
        check inside ``MessageService.prepare_user_message_with_files``, which
        compares each file against the *session* owner, would refuse them.
        ``uploader_user_id`` tells that check who actually uploaded the bytes.

        This is the only call site in the codebase that passes it as anything
        but ``None``, and this method is where that is safe to do: the guard at
        the top of the body has already *enforced* ``user.id ==
        binding.user_id``, so the value is not a caller's claim about identity
        but an invariant this frame just checked. The authorisation — may this
        person write into this session at all — was settled upstream by
        ``assert_access``, which re-reads the whole grant on every message.
        ``uploader_user_id`` answers *who uploaded these bytes*, never *may
        they*. A second caller wanting it is a design conversation, not a
        parameter.

        The three ids were stamped when the session was created and are re-read

        ``owner_id`` comes from ``session.user_id`` because that is what
        identity ownership *means* here (the session lives in the owner's
        space). It is not trusted: condition 6 pins
        ``binding.owner_id == agent.owner_id == owner_id``, so a row whose
        ``user_id`` disagrees with its own binding is rejected rather than
        honored.

        All three columns are required. A partially-stamped row cannot be
