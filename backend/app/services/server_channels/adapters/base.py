"""Channel adapter contract — the seam between transport and pipeline.

An *adapter* owns everything platform-specific about one inbound transport
(Google Chat, Discord, Telegram, …): how to prove a request really came from
that platform, how to read a message out of its payload shape, and how to
send a reply back. Everything above it — whitelisting, user resolution,
routing, session binding — is transport-agnostic and lives in
``channel_inbound_service``.

Adding a channel is therefore a new module plus one registry entry. No
migration, no pipeline change.

Two rules the pipeline depends on:

1. ``verify_inbound`` is the *single* authentication chokepoint. It runs
   first, before any other field of the payload is trusted, and it raises
   rather than returning a partial result. Nothing downstream re-checks the
   signature.
2. Every value on ``ChannelInboundMessage`` is attacker-influenced except
   those the adapter took from *verified* claims. Adapters must document
   which is which; the pipeline treats ``sender_email`` as transitively
   trusted only because the adapter verified the platform's signature over
   it.

Both rules survive the transport split; what changes is *which method* holds
rule 1 for a given transport. A push transport authenticates in
``verify_inbound``; a pull transport authenticates inside ``poll``, which
restates the same promise for messages nobody pushed; an **authenticated**
transport holds it nowhere in this file at all, because its caller was already
an authenticated platform user before the platform heard from them (App MCP
presents a bearer token this platform minted). The mode is a **declared
capability** (``ChannelCapabilities.inbound_mode``), never inferred from which
ABC an adapter happens to subclass — the declaration is what the registry, the
channel service and the pollers dispatch on.

Rule 2 gains a corollary the split makes unavoidable: *how strong* "verified"
is now differs per transport. Google Chat's ``sender_email`` comes out of a
Google-signed JWT; email's comes out of a ``From:`` header and is spoofable.
Both feed the same pipeline, so each transport must say which tier it offers
where an admin can read it.
