"""CommonMark → Google Chat markup.

Agents answer in Markdown. Google Chat's ``text`` field is **not** Markdown:
it has its own small markup language, and ``spaces.messages.create`` offers no
way to say otherwise — the ``markupSyntax`` enum
(``MARKUP_SYNTAX_CHAT`` / ``MARKUP_SYNTAX_MARKDOWN``) exists only as a
*read-side* parameter on ``spaces.messages.get``. So ``**bold**`` reaches the
reader as four literal asterisks, and there is no flag that fixes it. This
module is the translation.

The mapping, and where it is lossy:

===================  ==========================  =======================
Markdown             Chat                        Note
===================  ==========================  =======================
``**b**`` ``__b__``  ``*b*``                     one asterisk, not two
``*i*``              ``_i_``                     ``*`` means BOLD in Chat
``_i_``              ``_i_``                     already correct
``~~s~~``            ``~s~``
```` `c` ````        ```` `c` ````               unchanged
fenced block         fenced block                info string dropped
``[t](u)``           ``<u|t>``
``# H`` … ``###### H``  ``*H*``                  Chat has no headings
``- x`` / ``* x``    ``- x``
``1. x``             ``1. x``                    literal; Chat has no <ol>
``---``              a rule of box-drawing dashes
table                monospace block             Chat has no tables
===================  ==========================  =======================

Two things are load-bearing rather than tidy, and both are about *not*
translating:

* **Code is masked first and restored last.** Fenced blocks and inline spans
  are lifted out before any substitution runs and put back after. Without that
  a snippet containing ``**kwargs`` or ``a * b`` gets "formatted", which is
  worse than the literal asterisks this module exists to remove.
* **Emphasis needs word boundaries.** ``snake_case``, ``file_name.py`` and
  ``__init__`` are not italics. Every emphasis pattern below is anchored on
  non-word delimiters, and the underscore forms additionally refuse to match
  when a word character sits against the marker.

# whatever span 0 happens to be, while a literal ``\x02`` comes out as a stray
