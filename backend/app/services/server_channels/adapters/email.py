"""Email channel transport — the first *polled* channel.

Trust chain, stated as plainly as Google Chat's is, because the two now feed
the same pipeline and they are **not the same tier**:

    Google Chat  sender_email comes out of a Google-signed JWT.
    Email        sender_email comes out of the ``From:`` header, and the
                 ``From:`` header is **spoofable**.

Anyone who can get a message into the polled mailbox can claim any address in
it. Nothing below ``poll`` re-checks the sender — the whitelist, user
resolution, auto-registration and identity routing all treat that address as
the sender's identity — so the whitelist on an email channel is only as strong
as the mail server's own anti-spoofing (SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement at
delivery time). That sentence belongs in the admin UI, and
:meth:`EmailChannelAdapter.get_setup_instructions` puts it there.

**Inbound** reuses the retained IMAP/MIME mechanics on
``EmailPollingService`` — this module is a driver over them, not a second IMAP
implementation.

**Outbound** does not send. It enqueues into ``outgoing_email_queue``, which
``sending_scheduler`` drains with retries. Server Channels' own outbound is
best-effort by design; email is the one transport that already had a durable
queue, so it keeps it (plan §2.4). Google Chat is deliberately left as it was.

**Config** (non-secret, in ``ServerChannel.config``)::

    {"incoming_server_id": "<mail_server_config uuid, type=imap>",
     "outgoing_server_id": "<mail_server_config uuid, type=smtp>",
     "incoming_mailbox": "support@corp.com",
     "from_address":     "support@corp.com"}

Credentials are **not** here and not in ``ServerChannel.encrypted_secrets``.
They stay in ``mail_server_config.encrypted_password``, backend-only,
superuser-owned, never near an agent — which is why this transport declares
``needs_outbound_credentials=False``.

        is: the sender identity is the ``From:`` header, and **it is
        spoofable**. There is no signature over it, no platform-issued user id
        behind it, and no second gate anywhere below. An email channel's

        most valuable for are exactly the ones routing never sees: a sender the
        whitelist denies, one the channel policy turns away, one with no
        platform account. Those declines are deliberately silent to the sender
        on a polled transport (a reply would be a probing oracle and a spam
        amplifier), so the operator is the only audience — and until now their
        only trace was ``ChannelDebugBuffer``, which is in-memory and
        process-local. On email, the one transport whose senders are external
        by definition, "silent to the sender and gone at the next restart" is
        not an audit story. The row is.

        **Duplicate suppression, and how far it goes.** A ``Message-ID`` is
        globally unique, so an arrival whose id is already on file is a
        redelivery — which happens for real: ``_mark_email_read`` logs and
        swallows an IMAP failure, so a mail can stay unread and come back on
        the next tick, and it comes back across a restart too, where the
        pipeline's in-memory ``_seen_recently`` cache no longer remembers it.

        The disposition depends on what the stored row says happened last time,
        and the split is deliberate:

        * **Already routed** (``agent_id`` stamped) — dropped here and never
          returned. This is the expensive redelivery: first contact would run
          classification again and can auto-install a bundle again. It is also
          the only case where dropping is safe, because "an agent already
          answered this" is a fact, not a guess.
        * **Not routed** (``agent_id`` NULL) — returned, and the row is left
          alone. The mail was denied, or its routing failed; both are states a
          retry may legitimately resolve, and the pipeline's own recovery paths
          are written on the assumption that a message it failed to process can
          come back. Suppressing those here would silently defeat them.

        Never fatal. A storage failure must not cost the platform an inbound
        message: the row is bookkeeping, the mail is the product.

        the tick, so spending this channel's budget on it would shrink the
