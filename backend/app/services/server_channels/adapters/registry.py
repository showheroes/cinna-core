"""Adapter registry — dispatch by ``channel_type``.

A module-level dict, deliberately. Adapters are stateless singletons (all
per-channel state lives on the ``ServerChannel`` row passed into every call),
so one instance per type is correct and there is nothing to manage.

Adding a channel: write the adapter module, add one line here.

Since the transport split this module is also where "what shape is this
transport?" is answered. The answer always comes from the adapter's declared
``ChannelCapabilities`` — never from which ABC it subclasses — so a caller that
needs to branch on transport shape asks here instead of reaching through
``adapter.capabilities`` and inventing its own default.

    This is *not* the isinstance-based inference the split exists to avoid —
    dispatch reads ``capabilities.inbound_mode`` everywhere, and this check
    never chooses a behaviour. It only refuses to boot on a self-contradiction,
    which is the one thing the class can legitimately be read for.

    Both directions are wrong, and both are checked:

    * subclass without the declaration — registered as a webhook channel, so
      the poller never picks it up while its inherited ``verify_inbound``
      refuses everything that arrives: a channel that silently receives
      nothing.
    * declaration without the subclass — the worse one, because everything
      *looks* live. ``verify_inbound`` is abstract, so a plain ``ChannelAdapter``
      has a real, working one; the channel gets a minted token and a webhook
      that genuinely accepts traffic, while the admin is told it has none and
      the poller crashes with ``AttributeError`` reaching for ``poll()``.

    Both non-webhook modes are checked the same way and for the same reason.
    An ``authenticated`` transport has no ``poll()`` for the second failure to
    crash on, which makes it *quieter*, not safer: without the subclass it
    keeps a live, working ``verify_inbound`` while its whole premise is that no
    unauthenticated request can reach it.

    The token rule rides along for the same reason: a transport that declares
    a non-``webhook`` mode and ``needs_webhook_token=True`` has asked for a
    token on a door it says it does not have. So does the outbound-credential
    rule: a transport that declares its credential lives outside
    ``encrypted_secrets`` and then inherits the default
    ``has_outbound_credentials`` has said where its credential is *not* without
    ever saying where it is, and the admin projection answers "none configured"
    for every channel of that type.
