"""App MCP channel — the first *authenticated* transport.

Trust chain, stated as plainly as the other two, because all three now feed
the same policy object and they are **not the same tier**:

    Google Chat  sender_email comes out of a Google-signed JWT.
    Email        sender_email comes out of the ``From:`` header — spoofable.
    App MCP      there is no sender_email. The caller holds a bearer token
                 this platform minted for a specific ``user_id``, verified
                 against ``app_mcp_token`` on every request.

That last line is why this adapter is almost empty. The other two transports
exist to turn an outside identity into a platform user; App MCP starts with
one. There is nothing to whitelist, nothing to auto-register, nothing to
sign-check, and no outbound credential — the answer to an MCP call is the
response to that same call.

So what is the ``ServerChannel`` row for? Everything *above* the transport,
which is the half App MCP never had: a server-wide kill switch, ``visibility``
plus a grant allowlist, per-user enablement, and an agent scope. Those are
enforced where App MCP is actually entered — ``app.mcp.app_token_verifier``
reads this channel on every token verification — not here.

**Singleton.** ``/mcp/app/mcp`` is one endpoint per deployment, so
``is_singleton=True`` and ``ServerChannelService`` refuses a second row. Two
rows would be two policies over one door with nothing to say which wins.

**No config, no secrets, no whitelist.** ``validate_config`` rejects anything
non-empty rather than ignoring it: a value nothing reads is worse than a
refusal, because it looks configured. ``email_whitelist`` stays NULL and is
inert — the whitelist check lives in the inbound pipeline's post-verification
step, which this transport never enters — but a NULL whitelist *rendered in the
admin form* reads as "this channel denies everyone", which is why the admin UI
hides the field for a transport declaring this shape rather than merely
ignoring it.
