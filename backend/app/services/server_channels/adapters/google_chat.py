"""Google Chat channel adapter.

Trust chain, stated plainly because everything downstream rests on it: the
bearer JWT on the webhook proves *Google Chat* sent the event — issuer
``chat@system.gserviceaccount.com``, RS256 against Google's published JWKS,
audience pinned to this channel's GCP project number. The sender email inside
the payload is then trusted *transitively from Google*, the same tier the
email integration extends to IMAP. Verification is the first thing that
happens and it fails closed.

Outbound uses the Chat REST API with a ``chat.bot`` access token minted from
the channel's service-account JSON via the JWT-bearer grant. That is done with
PyJWT (already a dependency) rather than pulling in ``google-auth`` for one
signed assertion. Tokens are cached per channel until shortly before expiry.

Three verbs are used: ``create`` for replies and notices, ``patch`` to rewrite
a progress notice in place — including the last rewrite, which puts the agent's
own answer into the notice's slot — and ``delete`` for the rare turn that ends
with nothing to say. The last two are app-auth-restricted to messages this app
posted, which is all the pipeline ever asks of them.

``delete`` is deliberately off the common path: Chat renders a deleted message
as a "Message deleted by its author" tombstone, so clearing the notice once the
reply was posted beneath it put one of those above every single answer.

Everything on the way out is translated from CommonMark to Chat's own markup
(``google_chat_format``). Chat's ``text`` field is not Markdown and
``spaces.messages.create`` has no ``markupSyntax`` parameter to make it so, so
untranslated agent output reaches the reader as literal asterisks.

Every outbound call passes the shared egress guard.

        """Vet one redirect hop; say whether the bearer token may follow it.

        Returns ``(target_url, keep_authorization)``.

        Chat media does not hand back the bytes itself — it answers with a
        redirect to a signed URL on a *different* Google origin
        (``googleusercontent.com``, ``storage.googleapis.com``). Refusing to
        leave the origin, which an earlier draft of this method did, therefore
        fails every real download rather than only the hostile ones. So the
        hop is followed. What does not follow it is the credential:

        **A cross-origin redirect is followed with the ``Authorization``
        header STRIPPED, and that strip is load-bearing — do not "simplify"
        this back into an unconditional header pass-through.** The header
        carries this channel's ``chat.bot`` access token, a credential for the
        whole Chat API on that channel, and the target host is named by the
        *response*, not by this code. The signed URL authenticates itself
        through its own query signature and has no use for the token; sending
        it anyway would post a live API credential to whatever host the
        response chose. That is the leak this branch exists to prevent.

        Same **scheme and host and port** — a genuinely same-origin hop, which
        is what an ordinary Chat-side redirect looks like — keeps the header.
        Anything else, including a host that merely differs by port, is
        cross-origin and loses it. Nothing here trusts the target: stripping
        the credential is not permission, it is only the reduction of what a
        bad target could take.

        Three rules hold on **both** branches:

        * **``https`` or nothing.** A ``Location`` of ``http://…`` is refused
          outright, same origin or not. ``egress_guard.ALLOWED_SCHEMES`` is
          ``("http", "https")``, so ``assert_url_allowed`` will **not** stop a
          downgrade — this check is the only one that does. Stripping the
          token does not make cleartext acceptable: the payload is someone's
          file, and on a same-origin hop the token is still attached.
        * **``assert_url_allowed`` on every hop.** "Same origin as a URL that
          passed once" is not the same statement as "allowed" — DNS can answer
          differently on the second lookup, which is the whole point of the
          rebind defence — and a cross-origin target has never been checked at
          all. It is the SSRF guard, and it is what keeps a redirect from
          steering this request at a private address.
        * **a bounded chain.** :data:`_MEDIA_MAX_REDIRECTS` in the caller.

        ``httpx.InvalidURL`` is caught explicitly: it does **not** subclass
        ``httpx.HTTPError``, so the caller's handler would not have caught it
        and it would have escaped :meth:`fetch_attachment`, whose contract is
        to raise nothing but :class:`ChannelAttachmentUnavailable`. A
        ``Location`` header of ``http://[::bad`` is enough to reach it.

        the thread shows one bot message rather than a notice, a deletion
        tombstone, and a reply.

        Chunked, unlike :meth:`update_message` — this is a delivery and the
        text is an agent's, so it can be any length. The first chunk replaces
        the named message; the rest are posted after it in the ordinary way.

        Falls back to a plain send if the patch fails, which is the case that
        matters in practice: the notice may have been deleted by hand, or its
        id may have gone stale. Losing the slot is cosmetic; losing the answer
        is not. The fallback re-sends the **untranslated** ``text``, because
        ``send_message`` translates and running ``markdown_to_chat`` over
        already-translated markup would corrupt it (Chat's ``*bold*`` reads
        back as Markdown italics).

        That fallback is why the return is a ``ChannelReplaceResult`` rather

        keep it — depends on which of the two happened. ``replaced=False``
        says the named message is still standing and still says whatever it
        said. See :class:`ChannelReplaceResult`.

        **Once the patch lands, ``replaced=True`` is not negotiable — even if

        transferred at the patch: it holds the answer now, whatever happens
        next. Letting a failed remainder raise reported the *pre-patch*
        ``replaced=False`` to ``ChannelOutboundService._deliver`` (it is bound
        before the ``try``), which kept the notice id on the binding — and 45
        seconds later the pending-flush loop patched "working on your
        message…" over a delivered reply, the exact overwrite this result type
        exists to prevent. So a remainder failure is swallowed and logged, and
        the deliberate cost is that a **truncated** reply is reported as
        delivered. That is strictly better than a complete reply being patched
        away next turn, and the warning keeps it diagnosable.
