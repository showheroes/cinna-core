"""In-memory capture of recent channel traffic, for the admin debug panel.

Configuring a channel against a real provider is a blind exercise: the webhook
either fires or it does not, and when it does the pipeline's decision — denied
by the whitelist, routed to an agent, parked behind an install — leaves no
trace an admin can see. Every diagnostic signal the feature emits deliberately
avoids logging message text, so "did my message arrive, and what happened to
it" has no answer short of reading the server log.

This buffer is that answer. It is a *debugging aid*, not an audit trail:

- **In memory.** The buffer dies with the process, and nothing here is written
  to the database. ``SecurityEvent`` remains the durable, auditable record of
  denials and verification failures; this is the live view beside it.

  This used to say "never persisted", and to argue that inbound message text at
  rest was something the feature avoided outright. That is no longer true of the
  feature as a whole: ``routing_decision`` (Auto Routing Tuning) stores the
  routing message — clamped, superuser-only, expired on a retention window, and
  behind ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` — because a routing trace without
  the message cannot diagnose a routing failure. The reasoning is set out in
  ``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §7: the exposure *class* is
  unchanged (same text, same superuser audience as this buffer), what changes is
  the duration. It remains true of **this** module: the buffer itself persists
  nothing. Each event carries the durable trace's id in ``detail.trace_id``, so
  a live row here links to the row that outlives the process.
- **Bounded twice** — per channel (ring buffer) and per entry (text clamp) —
  so a busy or hostile channel cannot grow it without limit.
- **Superuser-only on read.** Text held here is no wider an exposure than the
  admin surface already grants: a superuser can read the resulting session's
  messages through the platform anyway. It is not therefore *free*, which is
  why the bound is small and the lifetime is the process.

Recording must never break the pipeline. Every entry point swallows its own
errors — a debug panel that fails an inbound webhook would be worse than no
debug panel.

That guard protects the *recording*, not the caller's argument expressions,
which Python evaluates first: an f-string like ``f"...{bundle.name}"`` at a
call site raises before ``record`` is entered, and in the inbound pipeline
that lands in a broad ``except`` that abandons the install. Keep summary
arguments to attributes you are certain exist.
