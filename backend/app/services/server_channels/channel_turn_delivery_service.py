"""Writes and reads of the per-turn outbound delivery ledger.

The durable counterpart to ``channel_stream_relay``'s in-memory state: one row
per external message a channel turn wrote. See
``app/models/server_channels/channel_turn_delivery.py`` for the schema and for
why ``session_message_id`` is nullable.

**Every function here is total.** Not as defensive habit — as the module's
contract. Its two callers are the streaming relay (a passenger on somebody
else's turn) and ``channel_outbound_service``'s event subscribers (whose §11a
discipline forbids a raise on the delivery path), and both call it *after* the
message has already gone out. A ledger write that raised would abort
bookkeeping about a delivery that already happened, or worse, take the
delivery's own handler down with it. A lost ledger write costs observability,
never a reply — so every entry point swallows, logs, and returns a value that
tells the caller "no ledger" rather than propagating.

**One exception, and it is a read:**
:meth:`ChannelTurnDeliveryLedger.platform_agent_for_message`. Neither of its
callers is on the delivery path, and each owns its recovery. The
conversation-context builder asks "did this platform write the quoted message,
and which agent?" and rolls back and degrades. The routing path
(``ChannelInboundService._quoted_platform_agent_id``) asks which agent to prefer,
on a short-lived session of its own, and reads any failure as "no preference".
Any further caller must own recovery the same way. Swallowing a failed
``SELECT`` here would hand a caller a session whose transaction is already
aborted, disguised as the ordinary answer "not ours".

**Commit discipline is copied from ``_persist_status_message_id``**: each
function owns its write, commits it, and rolls back inside its own guard on
failure. Callers hand in the session they already have — the relay's per-flush
session, the subscriber's ``create_session()`` — and this module never opens
one, never holds one, and never keeps an ORM instance past its own call.

**Boundary writes only.** Nothing here is called from the relay's rolling
~3-second draft patch. The three write moments are a seal, the fresh draft
that opens after a seal, and the final delivery at completion.

        1. **Adoption.** Every pending row for this thread (written at a
           boundary, before the emitter had named the turn's agent message)
           gets ``session_message_id``. This is the only place the column is
           ever filled in, and the id always comes from the stream event —
           never from a lookup. The rows are renumbered ``0..n-1`` in delivery
           order, which is what makes ``part_index`` dense and the unique
           constraint satisfiable even when a previous interrupted turn left
           its own pending rows behind.
        2. **The final row.** The last pending ``draft`` becomes ``final``; if
           there is none — a turn that never sealed, or one with no relay — a
           fresh row is inserted.
        3. **The divergence check**, in :meth:`_check_prefix`.

        ``session_message_id`` of ``None`` means the emitter said this turn
        wrote no agent message (or the event predates turn identity). Nothing
        is adopted and no final row is written: a ledger row that cannot name
        its turn is worse than no row, and the pending rows stay pending for
        the next completion on this thread.

        ``write_final=False`` does step 1 and step 3 without step 2. It is for
        the arms of ``handle_stream_completed`` that deliver **nothing** and
        still have to attribute what a broken relay already put on screen —
        writing a ``final`` row there would record a delivery that did not
        happen, while leaving the rows pending hands them to the next
        completion on the thread.

        **Idempotent against its own re-invocation**, which is reachable: the
        gate in :meth:`turn_already_settled` deliberately lets a turn whose
        final delivery *failed* be retried. So the final row is looked up
        before it is inserted, and the renumbering starts above whatever this
        message already owns — otherwise the second pass would insert straight
        onto the unique constraint and lose the row it was trying to correct.

        **Observational only, and that is deliberate.** The settled reply is
        the relay's own accumulated text and not the stored ``SessionMessage``
        content — decided with the user, and recorded in
        ``server_channels_tech.md`` under "The finalize divergence policy". So
        this method delivers nothing, withholds nothing and re-sends nothing
        in either outcome: the tail went out before it ran, exactly as it did
        before this table existed. What it adds is that the assumption is now
        *checked*: a mismatch marks the sealed row ``diverged`` and logs a
        warning, so "does this ever actually happen" becomes a question the
        logs can answer instead of one the design has to assume.

        The comparison is a prefix test in visible space — the sealed row's
        ``visible_char_end`` characters of the canonical answer, digested and
        compared against what the relay recorded having shown.

        ``row_ids`` are the rows :meth:`settle_turn` attributed **in this
        invocation**, and the candidate seals are drawn from them rather than
        from a re-query on ``session_message_id``. The two differ, and the
        difference is a false positive: adoption is deliberately greedy — it
        takes every pending row on the thread so a previous turn's rows cannot
        leak forward — so a re-query would also return rows a previous pass
        over this same message had already attributed, and compare this turn's
        answer against a prefix that is not this turn's. Narrowing to what was
        just adopted keeps the check keyed to the delivery it is checking; a
        turn with nothing to adopt has nothing to compare and returns.
