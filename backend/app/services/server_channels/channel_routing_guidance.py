"""Guidance replies: what the channel router says when it routes nowhere.

The classifier returns a categorical ``intent`` (``help`` / ``none`` /
``clarify``); it never authors the words a sender reads. This module holds the
two halves of turning that answer into a reply:

- :class:`RoutingGuidance` — **plain data** on ``RoutingDecisionResult``: which
  shape of reply, and the ballot entries it may list. Built inside
  ``ChannelRoutingService.decide`` from the sender's own post-policy ballot
  (their agents, the identities they may address) or from the catalog bundles
  ``CatalogService.user_can_install`` admitted for them — never from anything
  else, so a reply can only name what the sender could already have reached.
  Frozen strings and ids, pinned by ``tests/architecture/
  channel_routing_purity_test.py`` like every other value crossing that
  boundary.
- :func:`compose_guidance_reply` — a pure function from that data to text.
  **No sender text reaches it**: not the message, not a quote, not the model's
  ``message`` / ``reason``. Names and trigger prompts are configuration their
  owners wrote, collapsed to one line and clamped. The markdown it emits is the
  subset ``adapters.google_chat_format.markdown_to_chat`` translates (bold,
  ``- `` bullets, ``1. `` items); email receives it as written.

Nothing here imports a session, a model or a service: the composer is shared by
the effect half (``ChannelInboundService._route_new_thread``) and by
``POST /admin/routing/simulate``, which shows an admin the reply without
sending it.
