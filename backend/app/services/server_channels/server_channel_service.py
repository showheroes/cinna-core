"""Admin-side channel management: CRUD, secrets, tokens, auto-install, grants.

Everything here is superuser-facing. The inbound pipeline only borrows one
method from this service — ``get_by_webhook_token`` — and that method is the
reason the channel lookup is enabled-only: a disabled channel must be
indistinguishable from a nonexistent one at the webhook.

Secret discipline: ``ServerChannel.encrypted_secrets`` is written here and
read only by the adapter. It is never projected into a DTO, never logged, and
an update that omits the field leaves the stored value untouched (so an admin
editing the whitelist doesn't have to re-paste a service-account key).

Policy discipline: this service owns the admin-set *defaults* — the four
policy columns and the ``server_channel_user_grant`` allowlist. It does not
resolve them against a user. That is ``ChannelPolicyService``, and keeping the
two apart is what stops a second copy of the inheritance rules appearing on
the admin side.

        **This is the only function that answers "give me the App MCP
        channel".** Every caller — the admin list, the user-facing list, and
        the App MCP token verifier on its hot path — goes through here, and
        that is load-bearing rather than tidy.

        The verifier must **fail closed on a lookup error**, and "the row has
        not been materialized yet" is not an error. If the row were seeded at
        boot instead (``initial_data.py``), then every deployment whose seed
        had not run would deny every App MCP user — a kill switch stuck in the
        "off" position, on a surface that worked yesterday. Having exactly one
        function answer the question makes it impossible for the verifier's
        "not available" and the admin UI's "not configured" to drift apart:
        there is nothing to drift between.

        Shape borrowed from ``ServerConfigService.get_or_create``: deterministic
        read (oldest first, so concurrent first-hits converge on the same row),
        insert, and an ``IntegrityError`` guard that rolls back and re-reads.

        **Precondition: the caller must have nothing uncommitted on
        ``session``.** The insert below commits, and it commits the whole
        transaction — anything the request had staged rides along, and the
        ``IntegrityError`` path rolls the whole thing back. Every caller today
        is a read path (the admin list, the user-facing list, the token
        verifier's own short-lived session) with nothing pending, which is the
        only reason this is safe. A future caller that wants this row *and*
        has staged work must materialize the row first, or hand this function
        a session of its own.

        **The race guard works because ``ServerChannel`` carries
        ``UniqueConstraint("name")``.** Two workers reaching this at once both
        compute the same ``_singleton_name`` — it is derived from the
        transport's display name, not from anything per-request — so the loser
        collides on the *name* and re-reads the winner's row. That is the
        constraint actually doing the work; if the name were ever made
        non-unique, this would silently degrade into two rows of the same
        singleton type, each a policy over one door with nothing to say which
        wins. A uniqueness rule on ``channel_type`` would give the same guard a
        second and more direct reason to fire; it would not retire this one,
        because for two racing materializations the name collides first.

        Defaults come from the model — ``enabled=True``, ``visibility="public"``,
        ``default_enabled_for_users=True``, ``default_agent_scope="all"`` — and
        are deliberately *not* restated here. A restated default is a second
        copy that silently stops matching, and these particular values are what
        keep an existing deployment working exactly as it did before App MCP
        had a row at all.

        Raises ``UnknownChannelTypeError`` for a type with no adapter, and
        ``ValueError`` for a registered type that is not a singleton — the
        caller has asked a question with no single answer, and returning an

        Minting rather than raising is deliberate: the token is generated by

        create over a missing token would blame them for something they cannot
        provide.

        presence of the ``encrypted_secrets`` blob, which is where a transport
        declaring ``needs_outbound_credentials=True`` keeps its credential.
        Email declares ``False`` and overrides: its credential is the
        server-scoped SMTP config its ``outgoing_server_id`` names, so a fully
        operational email channel has an empty ``encrypted_secrets`` and the

        checks to see whether a channel can reply — as having no way to answer.

        The delegation is what keeps that knowledge in one place. This service
        must not learn what an ``outgoing_server_id`` is, and the registry
        refuses to import an adapter that declares ``False`` without saying
        where its credential actually lives.

        Public rather than private because ``ServerChannelPublic`` declares
