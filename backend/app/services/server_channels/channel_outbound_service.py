"""Outbound delivery: agent replies and progress notices back to the channel.

Two entry points:

* Event subscribers (``handle_stream_completed`` / ``handle_stream_error`` /
  ``handle_stream_interrupted``) registered in ``app/main.py`` next to the
  email integration's. They fire for every stream on the instance, so the
  first thing each does is a cheap gate — a dict lookup in the streaming
  relay's registry, then ``integration_type.startswith("channel_")`` —
  and everything else is only reached for sessions this feature owns.

  All three are **relay-aware**: when ``channel_stream_relay`` narrated this
  turn into the status notice, they deliver only the *tail* the reader has
  not seen yet instead of the whole answer again. When there is no relay
  (the feature is off, the transport has no notice, the stream came in
  through App MCP or A2A) every one of them behaves exactly as it did
  before the relay existed — see :meth:`ChannelOutboundService._take_stream_tail`,
  which folds every "pretend this feature does not exist" case into one
  ``None``.
* The **status notice** helpers (``set_status`` / ``set_binding_status`` /
  ``clear_binding_status``), called by the inbound pipeline to narrate the slow
  parts — routing, installing, ready, failed. On a transport that can edit its
  own posts that narration is ONE message, rewritten in place, and the last
  rewrite is the agent's own reply (``_deliver(into_status_notice=True)``) — so
  the notice does not disappear, it *becomes* the answer. A transport that can
  post but not edit gets each state as its own message instead (``set_status``
  falls through to ``_send_notice`` and keeps no id), and one that has no
  progress surface at all gets silence — both handled inside the helpers, so
  callers never branch on it.

Delivery is best-effort: three attempts inside the adapter, then the failure
is recorded on the binding and logged. A persistent outbound queue (the email
integration's ``OutgoingEmailQueue`` pattern) is a listed future enhancement —
until then a user whose reply was lost can simply ask again.

Everything here runs as an asyncio task on the main event loop. HTTP is async
httpx; the DB work mirrors what every other event handler on that loop does.

        ``None`` came from a relay that **broke** rather than from a session
        that has no relay at all.

        That second fact is the whole reason this form exists, and its absence
        has now produced the same defect twice in opposite directions.
        ``take_tail`` answering ``None`` (the relay broke, and may be holding
        the only copy of a partial answer in a standing draft) and
        ``("", False)`` (the relay is fine and the stream simply produced
        nothing, which is what stopping a turn before the agent speaks looks
        like) collapse into one ``None`` here — and
        :meth:`handle_stream_interrupted` needs them apart, because one must be
        met with silence and the other with the stopped marker. Asking a
        separate "is there a live relay" question instead cannot tell them
        apart either: both shapes have one.

        The two siblings do not need it — both recover through a full-text path

        relay was ever attached, so an import failure means there was none —
        or ``str(session_id)``) is honestly "no relay", and the caller is right
        to write the notice. A failure *after* one is in hand — the ``spent``
        read, ``take_tail`` itself — is a relay that demonstrably exists and
        whose draft may be standing in the notice; reported as "no relay" it

        The one place the three event subscribers ask "did
        ``channel_stream_relay`` narrate this turn, and if so what is left to
        send?". It answers with two values and no third state to get wrong:

        * ``None`` — **behave exactly as if this feature did not exist.** Take
          the pre-relay path: this turn's stored ``SessionMessage`` (resolved
          by the id the event carries, never by recency), the bare failure
          text, the notice-only stop acknowledgement.
        * a ``str`` — the relay owns this turn. Deliver this text (``""`` means
          it already delivered everything itself).

        Collapsing to that pair is the whole point, because the relay's
        ``take_tail`` has three answers and the two that look alike are not
        (its docstring, and the module docstring's "consumer contract", state
        this normatively — read them before changing anything here):

        * ``None`` from ``take_tail`` is "something in me broke", **not**
          "there was nothing". The agent's reply is in ``SessionMessage``
          whatever happened in the relay, so the honest recovery is the
          full-text path. Routing it to ``clear_binding_status`` instead would
          delete the notice and send nothing — losing an answer that exists.
        * ``("", False)`` — the stream genuinely produced nothing — also
          belongs on the full-text path, which degrades to the delete on its
          own when there really is no message text. It has to go there for a
          second reason: the registry is keyed by *session*, and a late
          handler can read the **next** turn's relay, which truthfully reports
          "nothing yet, nothing delivered". On the full-text path that handler
          settles its own turn's stored answer; on the delete path it would
          erase the notice of a turn still in progress.
        * only ``("", True)`` — "everything is already on screen" — is a
          genuine no-op, and that is the ``""`` this returns.

        Two things it deliberately does **not** do:

        * It never calls ``relay.stop()``. ``ChannelRelayEventHandler``'s
          ``on_complete``/``on_error`` own that and fire once per *turn*;
          ``STREAM_COMPLETED`` fires once per *LLM batch*, so stopping here
          would stream batch 1 live and leave every batch after it silent.
        * It never pops the registry entry, for the same reason:
          ``maybe_attach_channel_relay`` is the only writer, and the next
          batch's handler must still find the relay.

        A :attr:`~ChannelStreamRelay.spent` relay is read as absent — it is the
        registry's own discriminator for "the entry under this session id
        belongs to a turn that is already finished business" — and is answered
        *without* taking its tail.

        **Called before the DB session is opened, not inside it.** ``take_tail``
        waits on the relay's flush lock, which a flush holds across its adapter
        round trips (429 backoff included) — and that flush needs a pooled
        connection of its own to make them. A handler that waited there while
        holding one would put the two on opposite sides of the pool. The cost
        is that a turn whose binding vanished mid-stream has its tail taken
        with nowhere to send it, which delivers exactly as much as the
        pre-relay code did in the same situation: nothing.

        Total, like everything else on this path: any failure is "no relay".

        ``partial=True`` is for a caller whose stream ended **mid-token** —
        the interrupt and error handlers — and is passed straight through to
        ``ChannelStreamRelay.take_tail``, which then also hides a tag that was
        still arriving when the stream stopped. See that method: it is an
        opt-in because the stricter stripping would cost a completed reply the
        odd trailing ``"<c"``.

        The implementation is :meth:`_take_stream_tail_ex` with its second
        answer dropped, which is the only difference between the two and the
        reason this one still exists: two of the three subscribers genuinely do
        not care why the relay had nothing, and folding the flag into their
        branches would invite a reader to think it changes something there.

        returns having done nothing — it may not settle a notice on a fact it
        failed to establish. That case and the ``None`` above look alike and
        are opposites; the sentinel's note says why.

        The relay-present arm above is untouched: its tail is turn-scoped by
        construction, because the relay is created per turn.

        **The turn-delivery ledger wraps all of it.** Before anything is sent,
        an existing ``final`` row for this batch's agent message means the turn
        is already answered and this event is a duplicate — the one place a
        racing or redelivered ``STREAM_COMPLETED`` is stopped. After the send,
        :meth:`_settle_turn_ledger` attributes the rows the relay wrote at its
        seals, records the final message, and checks that the finalized
        canonical text still starts with what was already sealed into the
        thread. That check **changes no behaviour in either outcome** — the
        settled reply is the relay's own text by decision, and stays so — it
        only turns a silent assumption into a warning that can fire. Every
        ledger call here is total: a delivery is never gated on, delayed by, or
        lost to bookkeeping.

        every arm that actually wrote a message. It hands the turn's identity
        to the rows the relay wrote at its boundaries (the only place that
        column is ever filled in), settles the last one as ``final``, and runs
        the divergence check.

        ``canonical_text`` is the finalized ``SessionMessage`` content where
        the caller already has it — or, on a tool-only turn, the compact tool
        summary that was substituted for the stored placeholder and actually
        delivered: the ledger records what went out, and such a turn has no
        sealed rows for the divergence check to compare against anyway. Where it does not — the relay arms, which
        deliver the relay's own accumulated text and never load the row — it is
        read here, because the divergence check has nothing to compare against
        without it. That read is the *only* reason this arm touches the row at
        all, it happens after the reply is already out, and its failure
        (:data:`_UNREADABLE`) costs the check and nothing else: the ledger
        still records what was delivered.

        ``write_final=False`` is for the two arms that deliver **nothing** and
        still owe the ledger an attribution — see the call sites. They pass it
        because a ``final`` row would claim a delivery that did not happen,
        while leaving the rows pending hands a broken relay's already-posted
        messages to the *next* turn on this thread.

        Total twice over. The ledger's own entry points swallow everything, and
        this wrapper swallows again, because it is called from the middle of a
        handler whose remaining statements must run — §11a Rule 2, the same
        reason ``_deliver``'s argument expressions are hoisted.

        The counterpart to :meth:`_settle_turn_ledger` for the two handlers
        that end a turn **without** a completion: an interrupt and a
        mid-stream error. Without it their rows keep ``session_message_id
        IS NULL`` forever, and ``settle_turn``'s adoption is deliberately
        greedy — every pending row on the binding — so the *next* completion
        on this thread picks them up and stamps them with its own message id.
        That is wrong twice: the ledger records a previous turn's sealed
        message as part of a turn it was never in, and the divergence check
        then compares the new turn's answer against the old turn's prefix and
        reports a mismatch that did not happen. A check that cries wolf is
        worse than no check, because the mismatch policy is explicitly one we
        revisit "only if logs show it firing".

        **Attribution only — ``write_final=False`` and ``canonical_text=None``.**
        Nothing was delivered as this turn's answer, so no ``final`` row is
        written (which is also what keeps these rows out of
        :meth:`ChannelTurnDeliveryLedger.turn_already_settled`, whose gate
        matches on ``role == final``: a close-out can never be the reason a
        later real completion withholds a reply). And with no canonical text
        there is nothing for the divergence check to compare, which is correct
        rather than merely convenient — see below.

        **Why using ``agent_message_id`` here does not break the rule that
        this event's row must not be read.** The hazard the interrupt handler
        documents is that the row's *content* at this moment is whatever
        ``_flush_streaming_to_db`` last checkpointed — a partial of a partial,
        or the previous turn's text on a row not yet written. That forbids
        reading the content, and this does not read it: the id is used as a
        foreign key and nothing else, no text is loaded, and no claim is made
        about what was settled. It is deliberately routed around
        :meth:`_settle_turn_ledger`, whose convenience read of the canonical
        text is exactly the forbidden read on this path.

        **Idempotent by construction**, which matters because
        ``STREAM_INTERRUPTED`` fires once per interrupted *batch* and
        ``STREAM_ERROR`` has more than one emission shape. A second
        invocation finds nothing pending, stages nothing and commits nothing.

        A missing or unparseable id (``None``) leaves the rows pending and
        does nothing. Inventing a key would put a row under a turn that did
        not write it, which is the failure this method exists to prevent.

        Emitted **instead of** ``STREAM_COMPLETED`` when a turn is interrupted
        (``message_service`` guards the completion emission with
        ``if not was_interrupted``), so without this subscriber an interrupted
        channel turn leaves the notice stranded on "💬 Working on your
        message…" until the next turn patches it — telling the person we are
        still busy with something they cancelled. It is also what a channel
        ``/stop`` command will lean on for its visible acknowledgement once
        that command exists, which is why this is designed to say the whole
        thing itself rather than to be paired with a reply.

        **There is no full-text fallback here, and that is forced.**
        ``handle_stream_completed`` recovers by loading the message its event
        names (``handle_stream_error`` reads no row either — it has a fixed
        apology to fall back on); this one can do neither, because the stored
        message is not written yet when the event fires. That is also why no
        branch below resolves text through the event's ``agent_message_id``
        even though the event now carries one: the id may name a row whose
        content is still a mid-stream checkpoint, and reading it would
        reintroduce exactly the "a partial of a partial" text the branches
        below exist to avoid. The prohibition is on the row's **content**; the
        id is used once, below every branch, as the key that closes this
        turn's ledger rows out — see :meth:`_close_out_unsettled_ledger`.
        ``STREAM_INTERRUPTED`` is emitted the moment the ``interrupted`` event
        is seen, inside the streaming loop; ``_finalize_agent_message`` runs
        several hundred lines later, after the loop breaks — and bus handlers
        are dispatched with ``create_task``, so this one reaches the DB during
        that window. What it would read is whatever ``_flush_streaming_to_db``
        last checkpointed, which it does every two seconds against a relay fed
        per assistant event: a partial of a partial, or — since the row is
        created only on the first assistant event — the *previous* turn's
        completed answer, which is the shape a ``/stop`` before the agent says
        anything would produce every time. Every branch below therefore works
        from what is already on the reader's screen, and never from the row.
        Put the other way round: the standing draft is the best text available
        here — normally a superset of the row, and bounded-lossy by one flush
        interval against it.

        Five shapes, none of them clearing — the turn is over, and the
        tombstone rule in the band comment below applies:

        * **a tail to hand over** → into the notice, with the stopped marker
          under it, through ``_deliver`` so an over-long partial still chunks
          (``replace_message`` chunks; ``update_message``, which the notice
          verb uses, truncates — which is why the bare-marker branches may use
          that verb and this one may not).
        * **the relay put everything on screen already** (``""``) → the marker
          on its own, below the last sealed message.
        * **the relay broke and could not hand its tail over**
          (``relay_failed``) → **silence.** A relay that failed its tail read
          may still have a confirmed draft standing in the notice, and settling
          the bare marker over it would replace an answer the reader watched
          arrive with a two-word tombstone — permanently, since nothing else
          delivers that text. Leaving the draft alone costs the acknowledgement
          and keeps the answer, which is the right way round; the thread is
          then exactly where it would have been before this subscriber existed,
          and the next turn patches the notice.
        * **the relay is fine and the stream said nothing at all** → the
          marker, over the spinner. This is what ``/stop`` on a turn the agent
          has not started answering looks like, i.e. the likeliest interrupt
          there is, and it is the reason this handler asks
          :meth:`_take_stream_tail_ex` rather than its two-value sibling: that
          sibling reports this case and the broken-relay case with the same
          ``None``, and "is there a live relay at all" cannot separate them
          either — a turn interrupted before its first token has a registered,
          non-spent relay just the same. Answered with silence, which is what
          the collapsed form produced, the notice stays stranded on
          "💬 Working on your message…" on the very shape this subscriber was
          added for.
        * **no relay, and this thread was narrating** → the marker, settled
          over the spinner. Safe precisely because there was no relay: nothing
          but the pipeline's own progress text can be in that notice. Shares a
          branch with the case above: both have nothing to deliver and a notice
          that is standing, and both want the acknowledgement written into it.
        * **nothing narrating** → silence. A thread that was not showing a
          spinner gets no message about a turn it never saw start — which is
          also what holds the email transport at zero behaviour change, since a
          transport with no progress surface can never hold a notice id.

        **Why the ``""`` branch may settle over a standing notice id.** Not
        because the combination is unreachable; it is reachable, at least
        three ways. A prior batch's ``take_tail`` empties the draft while
        ``_deliver``'s fall-back-to-post keeps the id; a second interrupted
        batch reads the same relay again; and a concurrent next turn can write
        a fresh spinner onto the row before this handler runs. It is safe
        because of what such an id can *hold*: the relay releases the id on
        every seal, and ``_deliver`` keeps it only where it has already posted
        a superset of that text below. A notice standing at this point
        therefore never holds answer text that exists nowhere else. That is
        the property to re-check before touching this branch — not the
        reachability, which does not hold.

        Fires once per interrupted **batch**, like its sibling, so a turn whose
        second batch is also interrupted acknowledges twice. Left alone
        deliberately: the duplicate is one short line, and suppressing it means
        per-turn state in a handler whose whole virtue is having none.

        **It does not read the turn-delivery ledger either, and that is the
        same refusal.** "Was anything delivered this turn?" looks like a
        question the ledger could answer for the relay-absent arms, and it
        cannot answer it *for this turn*: the only key available here is the
        binding, because a row is attributed to its agent message at
        completion and this event is not one — and rows keyed by binding
        alone belong to whatever ran on this thread most recently, which is
        the recency inference the ledger exists to delete. The five branches
        below stay exactly as they are; they work from what is on the reader's
        screen, which is a fact this handler actually has.

        That refusal is about *reading* the ledger to decide a delivery, and
        it stands. It says nothing against *writing* to it once every such
        decision has been made and acted on, which is what the close-out in
        the ``finally`` does — and which is what stops this turn's rows from
        being adopted by the next completion on the thread.

        **Session-free on purpose.** Everything here is transport work — an
        HTTP call and an in-memory debug record — and taking a ``Session`` it
        never used invited callers to hold a pooled connection open across it.
        ``_route_new_thread`` did exactly that: its notice went out with the
        outer transaction still open, above the ``db.commit()`` whose own
        comment forbids it. The persistence half lives in
        :meth:`set_binding_status`, which does have a row to write to.

        Thread-keyed rather than binding-keyed because the first notice of a
        new thread is posted **before** the binding exists — routing has to run
        before anything can be bound, and routing is the slow part the notice
        is narrating. The caller holds the returned id as a plain value and
        writes it onto the binding once there is one, the same way it carries
        ``policy`` across that hop.

        ``None`` comes back when the transport has no progress surface at all,
        when the notice was delivered as an ordinary message (a transport that
        can post but not edit), and when the post simply **failed** — in all
        three there is nothing for a later ``clear`` to act on, which is
        exactly what a ``None`` id means to every caller.

        Those three are not equally benign, and the caller has to tell them
        apart itself: a ``None`` from a transport that declares
        ``supports_status_notice`` is a notice that should have been posted and
        was not, which on that transport is the sender's whole acknowledgement.
        ``_route_new_thread`` warns on exactly that combination.

        **Total, and that is load-bearing.** The band comment above says none
        of these three verbs raise, and this line is what makes that true of
        this one. ``channel.channel_type`` is not a field read: every caller
        arrives after a ``db.commit()`` that expired the instance, so it is a
        lazy reload — ``ObjectDeletedError`` (row deleted concurrently),
        ``OperationalError`` (pool timeout, disconnect) and
        ``PendingRollbackError`` (a poisoned session, which is exactly the
        state the failure handlers that call this run in) are none of them
        ``ChannelError``. A raise here escapes ``set_binding_status`` and
        ``_settle_notice`` alike, and the callers it escapes into are the ones
        with no handler left: the inbound pipeline's ownership hand-off (the
        binding row keeps the id while the caller settles a stale local, so
        the flush loop patches "ready" over the sender's last word) and the
        outer failure handler itself (the notice is stranded on "Setting up…"
        forever). Same treatment, for the same hazard, as
        ``_debug_channel_key``, ``_binding_thread_key`` and
        ``_persist_status_message_id``.

        ``settle=True`` writes the final word: the notice is rewritten and then
        *released* — the id is dropped so nothing later deletes it. Use it for
        text that is itself the answer, and never for a state the conversation
        moves on from.

        **The release happens only when the write actually landed.** A settle
        whose patch AND whose fallback post both failed has shown the sender
        nothing: the notice still stands with whatever it said before. Dropping
        the id there orphans that message — the next thing to write a notice on
        this thread has no id to patch, posts a fresh one, and the thread now
        carries the old text above the new. For the streaming relay it is worse
        than cosmetic: a seal that fails correctly does not advance the sealed
        offset, so the fresh message repeats the whole unsealed draft while the
        orphan stands with a prefix of the same paragraphs. Keeping the id
        instead costs nothing anywhere — the next notice patches the message
        that is already there, which is exactly the self-heal the pipeline
        already relies on — and it is what the module's stated invariant ("the
        notice id is released only when the patch really landed") always meant.

        **The same rule, and the same reason, without ``settle``.** A plain
        ``set`` whose patch and fallback post both failed used to write the
        ``None`` it got back onto the row, which is the identical orphan
        arrived at from the other side: the standing notice loses its only
        pointer. The pipeline's four ``set`` call sites — the two "working on
        your message…" patches, the "installing…" adopt-then-patch, and the
        "ready" that the drain's reply is about to take over — all want the
        stored id kept there, because each of them is followed by something
        that will patch that same message. Keeping it is also what makes the
        relay's failed *draft* patch survivable: the next flush retries the
        patch instead of posting the whole unsealed draft again underneath the
        orphan. Where there was no id, nothing changes: the write was a no-op
        either way.

        Returns **whether the text actually reached the thread**. Still total —
        the return value is the report, not an exception — and additive: every
        caller that narrates progress ignores it, because a notice that could
        not be posted is a cosmetic loss they cannot act on anyway.

        It exists for the one caller that can: the streaming relay
        (``channel_stream_relay``) *seals* a slice of the answer with this verb
        and then advances past it, never sending that text again. Advancing on
        an unconfirmed send turns a transport outage into a silent hole in the
        middle of the reply — strictly worse than today's loud total failure —
        so the relay needs to know.

        **Reading ``set_status``'s ``None`` as "it failed" is a borrowed
        certainty, so name what lends it.** That ``None`` has three meanings —
        the post failed, the transport has no progress surface at all, or the
        notice went out as an ordinary message on a transport that cannot edit.
        Only the first is a failure. The other two never occur on the paths
        that consult this return value, because ``maybe_attach_channel_relay``
        will not build a relay unless the channel's adapter declares
        ``supports_status_notice`` — the same capability ``set_status`` checks
        before it will keep an id — and the settle branch above only *keeps* an
        id a notice-less transport could never have had. Loosen that gate and
        this reading has to be revisited with it: a notice-less transport would
        then report every delivered message as a failure, and the relay would
        re-send every slice it had already put on screen.

        The one behaviour difference that reading is responsible for: on a
        transport with no progress surface at all, the guard now skips a
        ``_persist_status_message_id(db, binding, None)`` that used to run.
        It was a no-op — such a transport can never have obtained an id for
        the write to clear — and it is named here rather than left to be
        rediscovered, because it is the case a loosened capability gate would
        turn into a real one.

        The implementation is :meth:`set_binding_status_ex` with its second
        answer dropped — the same shape, and for the same reason, as
        :meth:`_take_stream_tail` over :meth:`_take_stream_tail_ex`. **The
        ``bool`` return is a contract**: the relay gates its seal advance on

        Answers ``(sent, external_message_id)``. The id is the transport's own
        name for the message this call wrote — the notice it patched, or the
        message it posted — and is carried for the turn-delivery ledger, which
        records which external message holds the turn's final text. ``None``
        where the adapter did not name one; the ledger stores that honestly
        rather than guessing.

        ``into_status_notice`` delivers **into** the thread's open status
        notice — the message that has been narrating this turn is rewritten to
        hold the answer — instead of posting a new one below it.

        That is the fix for what the delete-based version looked like in
        practice: Chat renders a deleted message as "Message deleted by its
        author", so clearing the notice after posting the reply put a tombstone
        above every single answer. Reusing the slot means the notice was never
        a separate message from the reader's point of view; it was the reply,
        arriving in stages.

        The id is released **when, and only when, the notice was really
        taken over**. It has to be: the message now holds the agent's answer,
        and the next turn's "working on your message…" would otherwise be
        patched straight over it.

        There are two ways not to take it over, and they used to be one.
        Delivery raising is the obvious one — the id stays, so the notice is
        still there to be rewritten or retried rather than orphaned
        mid-sentence. The other is invisible from here unless the adapter says
        so: ``replace_message`` degrades to an ordinary post when the patch
        fails, so a stale id (message hand-deleted, scope lost, id from before
        a redeploy) produced a *successful* delivery, a debug line claiming the
        reply had gone into the notice, and a released id — leaving "💬 Working
        on your message…" standing above the answer with nothing owning it and
        nothing able to rewrite it again. ``ChannelReplaceResult.replaced``
        makes that case visible, and the answer is to **keep** the id: the next
        turn patches that same message back to "working…" and self-heals, so a
        permanently broken patch costs one stale notice rather than one per
        turn. Deleting the orphan instead is not an option — that is the
        tombstone this whole mechanism exists to avoid.

        §11a Rule 2, and the worse twin of ``ChannelInboundService._reply``:
        this is the **agent-reply** path, so it carries the traffic the notice
        path does not. Five expressions were exposed inside the one ``except``
        — ``channel.id`` twice, ``binding.thread_key`` twice, and the
        ``f"...{exc}"`` summary, plus ``str(exc)`` in the ``_record_error``
        call and a lazily-interpolated ``exc`` in the log. Python evaluates
        every one of them *before* entering the callee, so neither
        ``ChannelDebugBuffer.record``'s never-raises guard nor
        ``_record_error``'s reached any of them. A raise in any one replaced
        the delivery exception, skipped the remaining statements, and left the
        failure invisible in the debug buffer **and** on the binding row — the
        two places an operator looks. Confirmed by firing poison objects, with
        ``logging`` disabled so the result is production behaviour and not
        pytest's re-raising capture handler.

        The success branch was exposed too, and had no ``try`` over it at all:
        ``channel_id=channel.id`` on a delivery that had already *succeeded*
        raised out of ``_deliver`` and turned a delivered reply into an error
        for the caller.

        Both reads are hoisted through total helpers and resolved once. The
        exception is rendered twice on purpose, by audience:
        ``describe_exception`` for the debug buffer, which is a superuser read
        surface an adapter's credential-echoing HTTP error must not reach, and
        ``_log_detail`` for the application log and the binding column, where
        the adapter's actual complaint is the whole diagnosis. Neither can
        raise; ``f"{exc}"`` and ``str(exc)`` both can.

           reached only after a delivery has already failed — which is
           precisely when a concurrently-torn-down binding is plausible.
        2. ``db.rollback()`` sat unguarded inside the handler. A session
           rolled back into an unusable state raises again from the very call
           meant to clean it up.

        **What this does not fix, and must not be read as fixing:** when the
        ``commit`` genuinely fails, the rollback discards ``last_error`` and
        the binding row keeps no record of the delivery failure. Guarding the
        write makes the failure *reportable*; it cannot make it *durable*.
        Durability needs the persistent outbound queue named in the module
        docstring, which is a listed future enhancement — until then the
        application log is the only surviving copy, which is why the caller
        logs before it calls this.
