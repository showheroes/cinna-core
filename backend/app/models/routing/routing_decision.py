"""RoutingDecision — the durable record of one routing decision.

``RoutingTrace`` (``app/services/routing/routing_trace.py``) captures a decision
in process memory; this table is where a closed trace lands. The in-memory
channel debug buffer answers "what just happened", for minutes, in one worker.
Tuning needs the other question — "why did it pick that, last Tuesday, on the
worker that has since restarted" — and only a row can answer it.

Two shape decisions worth knowing before editing this file:

- **``stages`` is JSONB, not child tables.** It is read whole, never queried by
  an inner field, and its shape follows the router's — which will keep moving
  (the two-pass channel structure is not the final one). Child tables would
  fossilise today's layout. Same call as ``InputTask.refinement_history`` and
  ``AgentEnvironment.config``.
- **``message_text`` is gated and ``stages`` is projected; ``message_sha256`` is
  neither.** Server Channels otherwise keeps inbound text out of the database;
  storing it here is a deliberate, documented exception (see the field comment
  and the plan's §7). With ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` off,
  ``message_text`` is withheld and every stage is projected through
  ``routing_trace.SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`` — an **allowlist**: a stage field is stored
  and served only if it has been declared free of the sender's words, so a field
  added later defaults to hidden rather than to exposed. Write path and read path
  both, from that one definition. With the gate off the hash still supports
  replay and dedupe, and the candidate set plus the verdict still answer the
  question that matters most — which agents were even considered.
- **The quoted message is gated with ``message_text``.** A channel message can
  reply to an earlier one, and the classifier is given that quote as context.
  ``quoted_message_text`` and ``quoted_message_author`` hold a *third party's*
  words and name label, so they are written and served under exactly the same
  ``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` rule. ``quoted_agent_id`` is an id the
  platform resolved, not sender text, and is not gated.

Rows are disposable. ``routing_trace_scheduler`` purges past
``ROUTING_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS``; nothing references a decision row, and losing
one loses a diagnostic, never state.
