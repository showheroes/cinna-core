    credential, in any provisioning mode (``publisher``/``template``/``user``).
    It is shown informationally so the UI can always tell the user the
    credential is part of a bundle, regardless of tier.

    ``bundle_pbp_usages`` is the PBP subset (``provided_by == "publisher"``)
    that drives the Tier-2 block and lets the UI deep-link to each affected
    bundle. ``active_install_count`` is the number of foreign installs
