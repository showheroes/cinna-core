#: Meta key on the terminal stream events (``STREAM_COMPLETED`` /
#: ``STREAM_ERROR`` / ``STREAM_INTERRUPTED``) carrying **turn identity**: the
#: id of the agent ``SessionMessage`` that batch wrote, stringified, or an
#: explicit ``None`` for a batch that wrote none.
#:
#: Defined here — the one module both sides already import — so the emitters
#: (``sessions/message_service.py``) and the consumer
#: (``server_channels/channel_outbound_service.py``, which re-exports it under
#: the same name) share one symbol. A consumer that reads a key the emitter
#: does not send falls back to its legacy newest-row arm *silently*, so the
#: two sides drifting apart is exactly the failure this shared symbol exists
#: to make impossible. The semantics of the key's three states, and which
#: events name a *finalized* row, are documented at the consumer's re-export.
