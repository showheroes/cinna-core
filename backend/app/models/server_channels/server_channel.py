"""ServerChannel — one row per admin-configured, server-wide channel instance.

A *channel* is an inbound transport that lets people outside the platform
(e.g. company employees on Google Chat) talk to platform agents. Each row
owns its transport trust model (``config`` + ``encrypted_secrets``), an
email-pattern whitelist, and an auto-registration toggle.

``channel_type`` must resolve in the adapter registry
(``app.services.server_channels.adapters.registry``); validation happens at
create/update time in the service layer, not here — the model stays a plain
value container so new adapters need no schema change.

Secrets discipline: ``encrypted_secrets`` is Fernet-encrypted at rest and is
**write-only**. No response DTO carries it; ``ServerChannelPublic`` exposes
only ``has_outbound_credentials``.

Availability discipline: the four policy columns on ``ServerChannelBase``
(``visibility``, ``default_enabled_for_users``, ``default_agent_scope``,
``allow_auto_install``) are the admin-owned **defaults**. What a given person
actually gets is the *resolution* of those defaults against their optional
``channel_user_setting`` row, and that resolution lives in exactly one place:
``app.services.server_channels.channel_policy_service.ChannelPolicyService``.
Nothing else may re-derive it — a second copy of the inherit rules is how a
channel ends up on for a user the admin switched off.

``ServerChannelPublic`` is the **admin** projection and carries
``webhook_token``, ``config`` and ``email_whitelist``. The user-facing routes
must never return it; see ``UserChannelPublic`` in ``channel_user_setting.py``.
