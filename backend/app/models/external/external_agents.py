Pydantic schemas for the External Agent Access API — Discovery and Session layers.

These are response-only schemas (no DB tables). They describe the unified
target list returned by GET /api/v1/external/agents and session metadata
returned by GET /api/v1/external/sessions, used by native clients (Cinna
Desktop, Cinna Mobile, etc.) to render the home screen and restore thread lists.
