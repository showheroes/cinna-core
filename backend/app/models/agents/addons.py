"""Wire shapes for the agent addons projection (no tables).

"Addon" is a presentation-layer umbrella over the two things an agent can carry
beyond its prompt: **plugins** (``AgentPluginLink`` rows — marketplace, bundle
or catalog) and **skills** (``skills/<name>/`` folders the engine loads). Both
already exist; what did not exist is one list that agrees about them.

The two sources overlap. A catalog install is *both* a plugin link and a skill
in the environment's index, and before this projection the agent page showed it
twice — once on the Plugins tab, once on the Skills card. The dedupe rule lives
here, on the server, so the tab, the CLI and any later consumer see the same
list rather than each folding the two halves their own way:

1. every plugin link is one row;
2. every ``source="local"`` index entry is one row;
3. index entries belonging to a plugin are **not** rows — they are attached to
   their plugin's row as ``skills[]``;
4. an index entry whose plugin has no link is attached to a synthetic *orphan*
   row, so nothing the engine can load is invisible here.

Nothing in this module is a table: the projection is derived on every read from
the plugin links plus the environment's cached skill index.
