"""SkillPackageRevision — an immutable snapshot of one published skill.

Append-only, exactly like :class:`~app.models.bundles.agent_bundle_revision.AgentBundleRevision`:
each publish writes a new row plus a directory snapshot under
``<SKILL_STORAGE_DIR>/<package uuid>/<revision_number>/skills/<name>/``. Rows
are never edited — an install pins to a revision id, and a pinned artifact that
can change underneath the container is not an artifact.
