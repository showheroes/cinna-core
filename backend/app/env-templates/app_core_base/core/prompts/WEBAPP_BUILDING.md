# Web App Building Guide

## Overview
You can build a web application for data visualization at `/app/workspace/webapp/`.
This webapp is served through the platform and can be shared via URL or embedded as an iframe.

## Directory Structure
Place all webapp files in `/app/workspace/webapp/`:
- `index.html` — required entry point
- `assets/` — CSS, JS, images
- `pages/` — additional HTML pages
- `api/` — Python scripts that serve dynamic data (see Data Endpoints below)

## Technology Rules
- The final webapp must consist of **production-ready static files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Use CDN-loaded libraries: Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Plotly.js, AG Grid, Alpine.js, htmx, etc.
- You MAY use npm, bundlers (Vite, esbuild, etc.) during development to speed up your workflow
- But you MUST always produce a final built output in `/app/workspace/webapp/` — no dev servers, no `node_modules` at runtime
- The platform serves files directly from `webapp/` — there is no build step at serve time
- If you use a bundler, run the build and place output in `webapp/`. Remove build artifacts when done
- Keep files self-contained — the webapp must work when served as static files from any URL prefix

## Data Endpoints (Dynamic Data)
For dashboards that need live data from databases or APIs:

1. Create Python scripts in `webapp/api/` (e.g., `webapp/api/get_sales.py`)
   - **Files MUST have the `.py` extension** (e.g., `get_sales.py`, not `get_sales`). The platform resolves endpoints by looking for `{endpoint_name}.py` — files without the extension will not be found.
2. Each script:
   - Reads JSON params from stdin: `params = json.loads(sys.stdin.read() or '{}')`
   - Prints JSON result to stdout: `print(json.dumps(result))`
   - Can import any workspace packages, access databases in `/app/workspace/files/`, etc.
   - Default timeout: 60 seconds. Max allowed: 300 seconds (for heavy queries)
3. In your HTML/JS, call endpoints via relative URL:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('./api/get_sales', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({ params: { date_from: '2026-01-01' }, timeout: 60 })
   });
   const data = await response.json();
   ```
4. The `timeout` field in the request body controls how long the script can run (default 60s, max 300s).
   Use higher values for complex analytics queries on large databases.

## Data Endpoint Script Template
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Data endpoint: describe what this returns."""
import json
import sys
import sqlite3

def main():
    params = json.loads(sys.stdin.read() or '{}')

    # Example: query a database
    db_path = '/app/workspace/files/data.db'
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.execute(
        "SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date >= ? LIMIT ?",
        (params.get('date_from', '2020-01-01'), params.get('limit', 100))
    )
    columns = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]
    rows = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    conn.close()

    print(json.dumps({"columns": columns, "rows": rows, "total": len(rows)}))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Chat Integration Checklist

Before finalizing the webapp, evaluate these two questions:

### 1. Does the webapp display dynamic data (charts, tables, metrics, lists)?
If yes — **ask the user** whether they want the chat assistant to be aware of what the user is currently viewing on the page. If they confirm, you MUST add schema.org microdata markup to all data elements (see Schema.org section below) and include the context-bridge.js script in every page (see Context Bridge section below). Read `/app/core/webapp-framework/SCHEMA_EXAMPLES.md` for markup examples before writing the HTML.

### 2. Does the webapp have forms, filters, inputs, or other interactive elements?
If yes, **and the user has indicated that chat communication will be available for this app** — you MUST integrate Agent-to-Webapp Actions (see Actions section below). This allows the agent to update filters, fill forms, navigate pages, and reload data in response to chat messages. Without this integration, the agent cannot interact with the webapp UI. Read `/app/core/webapp-framework/ACTIONS_REFERENCE.md` before writing the HTML.

---

## Schema.org Microdata Markup

**Add schema.org microdata attributes to all significant data elements** in every HTML page. This enables the platform's chat assistant to understand what the user is currently viewing and provide smarter, context-aware responses.

Three HTML attributes work together:
- `itemscope` — marks an element as containing structured data
- `itemtype="https://schema.org/TypeName"` — specifies the type of data
- `itemprop="propertyName"` — marks a specific property value within the item

Add them to all significant data elements: tables, metric cards, filter forms, list items, navigation sections, and status badges. Every meaningful data display MUST have schema.org attributes — the chat assistant's context-awareness depends on it.

For full HTML examples for each element type, read `/app/core/webapp-framework/SCHEMA_EXAMPLES.md`.

## Context Bridge Script

The script `./assets/context-bridge.js` is **auto-available** in every webapp — you do not need to create it. Just include it as the last `<script>` tag before `</body>` in every HTML page:

```html
  <script src="./assets/context-bridge.js"></script>
</body>
```

For pages in subdirectories (e.g., `pages/detail.html`), adjust the path: `../assets/context-bridge.js`. Do not skip it on any page — the chat assistant cannot provide context-aware help without it, and agent action commands will not work.

## Agent-to-Webapp Actions

You can trigger UI changes in the webapp from your responses by embedding action tags:

```
<webapp_action>{"action": "action_type", "data": { ... }}</webapp_action>
```

Tags are automatically stripped from the visible chat message — the user only sees your regular text. Actions execute silently in the webapp.

| Action | When to use |
|---|---|
| `refresh_page` | After code changes in building mode |
| `reload_data` | After updating backend data in conversation mode |
| `update_form` | To fill form fields or apply filter values the user asked for |
| `show_notification` | To confirm completed actions or report errors |
| `navigate` | To take the user to a relevant section in an SPA |

For full documentation — data field specs, custom event listeners, and examples — read `/app/core/webapp-framework/ACTIONS_REFERENCE.md`.

### Making the Webapp Action-Ready

The `update_form` action works by finding a `<form>` element by its `id` attribute, then setting values on its child input/select/textarea elements by their `name` attributes. **This means:**

1. **Every `<form>` MUST have an `id` attribute** — without it, `update_form` cannot target the form. Example: `<form id="task-form" ...>`.
2. **Every form field MUST have a `name` attribute** — this is how `update_form` maps `values` keys to fields. Example: `<input name="title" ...>`, `<select name="status" ...>`.
3. **`update_form` only works on standard HTML form elements** (`<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`). It does NOT work on:
   - JavaScript framework state (Alpine.js `x-data`, React state, Vue refs, etc.)
   - Custom button groups, toggles, or filter chips that are driven by JS variables
   - Elements that only look like inputs but are actually `<div>` or `<button>` elements

**When the webapp uses JS framework state for interactive elements** (e.g., Alpine.js `x-data` for filters, tabs, or toggles), you MUST create custom actions with `webapp_action_*` event listeners so the conversation agent can control them. Do not assume `update_form` will work on framework-managed state.

**Rule of thumb:** For every interactive element in the webapp (forms, filters, tabs, sorting controls), ask yourself: "Can the conversation agent control this via existing built-in actions?" If not, implement a custom action event listener and document it in `WEB_APP_ACTIONS.md`.

## Maintaining the Actions Registry

The file `/app/workspace/webapp/WEB_APP_ACTIONS.md` is the actions registry for this agent.
It pre-documents the built-in action types. When you implement custom event handlers in your
webapp JavaScript (e.g., `window.addEventListener('webapp_action_my_action', ...)`), you MUST
add an entry to `WEB_APP_ACTIONS.md` describing the action type and what data it expects. This
keeps conversation mode informed about what custom actions are available to use.

## Best Practices
- Start with a single `index.html` for simple dashboards
- Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for clean, responsive layouts
- Use Chart.js or Plotly.js for charts, AG Grid for data tables
- Add loading states and spinners for data fetches
- Handle API errors gracefully in the UI (show user-friendly messages)
- For multi-page apps, use client-side routing or simple `<a>` links between HTML files
- Document your data endpoints in `webapp/api/README.md`
- **Add schema.org microdata to all data elements** (see Schema.org section above)
- **Include context-bridge.js in every HTML page** (see Context Bridge Script section above)

## Size Limit
Total webapp directory must stay under 100MB. Keep assets optimized.
Use minified CSS/JS when possible. Optimize images.

## What NOT to Do
- Do not leave dev servers running (`npm run dev`, `python -m http.server`, etc.)
- Do not leave `node_modules/` in the webapp directory — build and clean up
- Do not use server-side rendering frameworks that require a running server (Next.js SSR, Nuxt SSR)
- Do not write to files outside of `/app/workspace/webapp/`
- Do not hardcode absolute URLs — always use relative paths (`./api/endpoint`, `./assets/style.css`)
