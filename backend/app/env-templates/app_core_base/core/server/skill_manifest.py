"""Agent skills — ``SKILL.md`` parsing, validation and tree hashing.

An *agent skill* is a folder shaped like the open Agent Skills standard::

    skills/<name>/
    ├── SKILL.md            # required; YAML frontmatter + markdown body
    ├── scripts/            # optional
    ├── references/         # optional
    └── assets/             # optional

This module is the single source of truth for what a valid skill folder is.
It is consumed on **both sides of the container boundary**:

* the host backend imports it as ``app.services.agents.skill_manifest``;
* env-core imports the vendored copy at
  ``backend/app/env-templates/app_core_base/core/server/skill_manifest.py``.

env-core runs inside the agent container from ``/app/core`` and cannot import
backend modules, so the file is **vendored byte-identically** — the same
host ⇄ container mirror precedent as ``OPENCODE_RUNTIME_DIR_TEMPLATE``. A unit
test asserts the two files are identical; keep them that way by editing this
file and copying it over, never by editing one side.

Consequences of the mirror, which shape every choice below:

* **stdlib only** — no pydantic, no PyYAML, no project imports. The container
  image does not declare PyYAML, so frontmatter is parsed by the restricted
  subset parser in this module rather than ``yaml.safe_load``: one parser, one
  behaviour, host and container alike.
* **pure** — no I/O beyond reading the tree it is pointed at, no logging
  configuration, no globals that outlive a call.

How the frontmatter parser diverges from real YAML
--------------------------------------------------

:func:`parse_frontmatter` covers the shapes the Agent Skills standard actually
uses — top-level ``key: value`` scalars, flow (``[a, b]``) and block
(``- item``) sequences, block scalars (``|`` / ``>`` and their ``-`` / ``+``
variants), one level of nested mapping, a closing fence of ``---`` or ``...``.
Everything below is a deliberate difference from ``yaml.safe_load``. Read them
before widening what a ``SKILL.md`` may contain:

* **Inline comments are not stripped.** Only a line whose stripped form
  *starts* with ``#`` is a comment, so ``name: foo # note`` yields the string
  ``foo # note``.
* **Flow sequences split naively on commas.** ``[ "a, b", c ]`` becomes three
  items, not two — a comma inside quotes still splits.
* **Block-scalar chomping indicators are accepted but not honoured.** ``|``,
  ``|-`` and ``|+`` behave identically, as do ``>``, ``>-`` and ``>+``. Every
  line is stripped, so indentation inside a block scalar is lost, and the
  folded (``>``) form joins blank lines with a single space like any other
  line, so paragraph breaks do not survive.
* **Nesting is one level deep, and depth is not tracked.** A nested mapping's
  values are coerced as scalars. Deeper structure is not dropped, it is
  mangled: a grandchild ``key: value`` is hoisted into the *same* mapping,
  where it can silently overwrite a sibling, and any ``- item`` under a nested
  key is collected into a sequence that replaces the mapping outright.
* **A block-sequence item can be a flat mapping.** ``- key: value`` starts a
  mapping item, and each following indented ``key: value`` line (no dash)
  adds a key to that same item — this is how ``credentials:`` declares one
  slot per item. The item is recognised only when the colon is followed by
  whitespace or the end of the line, so ``- http://host/x`` and
  ``- Bash(git:*)`` stay scalars. Values inside an item are scalars: no flow
  sequences, no deeper nesting. This changed behaviour: a ``- key: value``
  item that used to parse as the string ``"key: value"`` now parses as a
  one-key mapping. Indentation inside a sequence item is not tracked: in an
  indented sequence, a ``key: value`` line at the dash's own indentation that
  follows a mapping item attaches to that item, where real YAML would reject
  it.
* **Unclassifiable lines are skipped, never raised on.** A malformed line
  simply disappears; only a missing or unterminated fence raises.
* **Scalar coercion uses a fixed, narrow token set.** ``yes`` / ``no`` are
  booleans (YAML 1.1, not 1.2) but ``on`` / ``off`` are not; ``null`` and
  ``~`` are null; a number is an optional minus followed by digits, optionally
  a dot and more digits — so ``1e3``, ``0x1f``, ``+5`` and ``.5`` stay
  strings, while a non-ASCII decimal digit does coerce to an int, because the
  digit class is Python's Unicode-aware one. Everything unrecognised stays a
  string, which is the safe posture for the unknown keys this module passes
  through untouched.
* **No anchors, aliases, tags, complex keys or multi-document streams.**
* **Keys are restricted to ASCII letters, digits, underscore, dot and
  hyphen.** Any other key shape is skipped along with its value.
* **Quote stripping does no escape processing.** Only a matching leading and
  trailing ``'`` or ``"`` pair is removed; a backslash-n inside the quotes
  stays two literal characters.
* **Duplicate keys: the last one wins**, silently.
* **``SKILL.md`` is decoded as utf-8-sig**, so an editor-written file that
  carries a byte-order mark still parses — the mark would otherwise sit in
  front of the opening ``---`` and fail the fence test.
