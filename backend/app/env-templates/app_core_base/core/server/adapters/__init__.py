"""
SDK Adapters Package

This package provides a unified interface for different AI SDK providers.

Two distinct abstractions live here:

- **SDK Adapters** (``*_sdk_adapter.py``) — orchestrate an SDK's lifecycle:
  subprocess management, session creation/resumption, streaming, interrupts.
  Each adapter converts its SDK-specific events into unified ``SDKEvent``
  objects via the corresponding event transformer.

- **Event Transformers** (``*_event_transformer.py``) — stateless or
  stateful translators that normalise raw SDK messages/events into the
  common ``SDKEvent`` format consumed by the backend streaming pipeline.
  Tool names are lowercased via ``tool_name_registry.py``.

Supported SDK adapters:
- claude-code/*: Claude Code SDK (Anthropic, MiniMax)
- opencode/*: OpenCode multi-provider agent (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
