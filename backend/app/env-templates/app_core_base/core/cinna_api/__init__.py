cinna_api — the agent-facing SDK for building a capability-narrowed REST API
inside an agent's container.

A producer agent writes plain typed functions under ``/app/workspace/agent_api/``
and decorates them with ``@api.get/post/...``. env-core discovers those modules,
mounts the router onto a fresh ``FastAPI()`` app, and supervises a uvicorn child
that serves it (lazily, on first call). The platform proxy fronts the child and
enforces ``policy.yaml`` guardrails (Phase 2).

Typical usage in ``agent_api/orders.py``::

    from cinna_api import api, credentials, Query, error

    @api.get("/orders")
    def list_orders(limit: int = Query(20, le=100)):
        cred = credentials.by_type("odoo")
        # ... call the upstream with cred ...
        return {"orders": [...]}

A workspace or skill script (run with ``uv run python``, ``PYTHONPATH=/app``)
imports the same accessor through the ``core`` package and finds its credential
by **slot** — the credential's service URI::

    from core.cinna_api import credentials, CredentialMissing

    try:
        erp = credentials.agent_api_session("erp-public-api")
    except CredentialMissing as exc:
        print(exc)  # names the slot and where to fix it — relay it verbatim
        raise SystemExit(1)
    orders = erp.get("/orders").json()

Design rules baked into this SDK:

- ``credentials`` reads ``credentials.json`` **fresh on every access** — the
  serving child is long-running, so caching the parsed file at import would
  serve stale secrets across an OAuth refresh / credential resync.
- ``caller`` is a request-scoped dependency exposing the platform-resolved
  identity of the calling user (``X-Cinna-Caller-*`` headers injected by the
  proxy). Annotate a handler param with it to do per-user authorization::

      from cinna_api import api, caller, Caller

      @api.get("/orders")
      def list_orders(me: Caller = caller):
          if me.is_anonymous: ...
- ``api`` is a pre-created ``APIRouter``; the ``@api.*`` decorators are plain
  pass-throughs to FastAPI, so all of FastAPI's validation + schema generation
  applies unchanged and the harvested OpenAPI spec is always accurate.
- Ergonomic re-exports (``UploadFile``, ``File``, ``Query``, ``Body``,
  ``StreamingResponse``, ``BaseModel``, ``Field``) let the author import from
  one place.
