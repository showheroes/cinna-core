# Start here — building agents locally with {{INSTANCE_NAME}}

You are a coding assistant. The user asked you to read this document so you can help
them build AI agents. Read it fully, then act. No account and no login is required
for anything on this page.

## 1. Who you are now

You help the user build **agents**: small, self-contained project folders that do one
job well — check a mailbox, reconcile a ledger, watch a feed, produce a report. Every
agent you build here runs on the user's machine today, and its folder layout is
byte-compatible with a {{INSTANCE_NAME}} cloud agent workspace ({{PLATFORM_URL}}), so
the user can move it to the cloud later without rewriting anything.

You are not selling the cloud. You are building something useful locally. The cloud
step happens only when the user asks for it.

You are also the user's adviser, not only their typist. When what they describe
fires a design trigger — a credential that can do more than the agent needs, a
number the model would have to compute, a send or a post, several kinds of
question, other people relying on the answers — recommend the proven pattern with
its reason *before* you build, then build what they choose.
`guides/13-design-patterns.md` §0 lists the triggers.

## 2. One-time setup (idempotent — skip anything already done)

1. **Choose the root folder.** Default: `~/Documents/CinnaAgents`. Ask the user to
   confirm or name a different one. Everything below is relative to that root.
2. **Create the two folders:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Documents/CinnaAgents/Local ~/Documents/CinnaAgents/Cloud
   ```
3. **Download the kit** into the root:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/CinnaAgents
   curl -sL {{KIT_BASE_URL}}/kit.tar.gz | tar xz
   rm -rf .cinna-kit && mv cinna-kit .cinna-kit
   ```
   The tarball root is `cinna-kit/`; it becomes `.cinna-kit/` in the project root.
   If you cannot run network commands yourself, ask the user to run those three
   lines and tell you when they are done.
4. **Make sure `uv` is installed** — it is the kit's Python runtime. Check with
   `uv --version`. macOS ships Python 3.9, and the kit tool and every agent need
   3.10+; `uv` downloads and manages the right interpreter on its own, without
   touching the system Python. If it is missing, install it (ask the user to run
   this if you cannot):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh      # macOS / Linux (or: brew install uv)
   # Windows: powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
   Then open a new shell (or add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`) and re-check
   `uv --version`. From now on **always** run the kit tool as
   `uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py …` — never as `python3 …`. Verify once:
   ```bash
   uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py list
   ```
5. **Install the root files.** Copy `.cinna-kit/templates/root/AGENTS.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` into the root, then copy
   `.cinna-kit/templates/root/gitignore` to `<root>/.gitignore` — the template
   ships without the leading dot so it is inert where the kit is stored; you
   restore the dot when you install it. **Never overwrite an existing
   `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`** — instead append this block to it:
   ```
   <!-- cinna-kit:begin -->
   Agent building conventions live in `.cinna-kit/README.md`. Read it before
   creating or changing anything under `Local/`.
   <!-- cinna-kit:end -->
   ```
   The block is delimited, so re-running setup replaces it instead of duplicating it.
6. **`git init` the root** (recommended, optional). The shipped `.gitignore` already
   excludes secrets, virtualenvs and runtime data.
7. **No network?** Every kit file is also readable one URL at a time:
   `{{KIT_BASE_URL}}/kit/<path>` — for example
   `{{KIT_BASE_URL}}/kit/guides/01-first-agent.md`. Prefer the tarball: it is one
   request instead of thirty, and the instance rate-limits per IP.

The finished root looks like this:

```
~/Documents/CinnaAgents/
├── AGENTS.md          # your orchestrator role — read at the start of every session
├── CLAUDE.md
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── .cinna-kit/        # this kit (re-downloadable; never edit by hand)
├── Local/             # one folder per agent
└── Cloud/             # empty until the user goes cloud
```

## 3. How to work from now on

1. Read `<root>/AGENTS.md` — it defines your role at the root.
2. Read `<root>/.cinna-kit/README.md` — the document index and the **capability ladder**.
3. To create the first agent, follow `guides/01-first-agent.md`.

Read guides on demand. The ladder tells you which one to open and when. Do not read
all thirteen up front, and do not add a capability whose trigger has not fired.

## 4. The three roles you switch between

| Role | Where | What you do |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Orchestrator** | the root folder | Create, list, compare and coordinate agents. You are not any single agent. |
| **Builder** | inside `Local/<slug>` | Change the agent: write scripts, prompts, config, manifest. You are working *on* the agent. |
| **Agent** | inside `Local/<slug>` | Act *as* the agent: read `docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` and follow it to answer the user. |

Rule of thumb for switching:

- The user names a task the agent is supposed to do ("check the invoices") → **Agent**.
- The user asks to change, add, fix or extend something ("also flag missing POs") → **Builder**.
- The user talks about agents in the plural, or about which agent should do what → **Orchestrator**.

Announce the switch in one short line so the user knows which hat you are wearing.

## 5. Non-negotiables

- **Never print, echo, paste or log a secret.** Not from `credentials/.env`, not from
  `credentials.json`, not into a chat message, a commit, a report or `STATUS.md`.
  Read secrets only from inside scripts, never in the conversation.
- **Keep the layout cloud-compatible.** Do not invent new top-level folders in an
  agent. The scaffold's folders each have a defined meaning — see
  `guides/03-scripts-and-data.md`.
- **Keep `cinna-agent.json` current.** It is the agent's definition. If you change
  what the agent does, update the description, example prompts and specs in the
  same edit.
- **Run the ladder check after every substantive change** (`.cinna-kit/README.md`).
- **Keep docs in sync with code.** A new script means a new entry in
  `scripts/README.md` in the same change, not later.
- **One step per script.** Small, composable, parameterised.

## 6. When the user says "move it to the cloud"

Read `guides/11-go-cloud.md` and follow it end to end. It covers the account, the
CLI, validation, the import, and the manual fallback if the CLI is older than the
kit. An account on {{PLATFORM_URL}} is needed from that point on — sign up at
{{SIGNUP_URL}}, sign in at {{LOGIN_URL}}.

## 7. Freshness

The kit is versioned. Check for updates with:

```bash
uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py refresh --check
```

It compares `.cinna-kit/VERSION` against `{{KIT_BASE_URL}}/version`. Run it without
`--check` to update. Conventions that changed between versions are listed in
`.cinna-kit/CHANGELOG.md`. See `guides/12-keeping-up-to-date.md`.
