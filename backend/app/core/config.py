    # ── Routing traces (auto-routing tuning) ────────────────────────────

    # (including rejected ones), rendered prompt, provider attempts, verdict.
    # See ``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §4/§7.
    #
    # RULE FOR EVERY SETTING BELOW — **the dangerous state must not be able to
    # look routine.** These knobs govern how much external users' message text
    # this platform keeps and for how long, so a value that means "retain more"
    # must not be reachable by typing something innocuous, and must not render
    # as an unremarkable number. Two instances to copy: this feature's most
    # dangerous configuration is unbounded retention, so
    # ``ROUTING_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`` REJECTS ``0`` at startup instead of
    # reading it as keep-forever (``-1`` is the only spelling, and you have to
    # mean it), and ``routing_trace_scheduler`` logs that ``-1`` as "retention
    # DISABLED" rather than "retention -1 days". Adding a setting here: name its
    # most dangerous value, then make reaching it loud.
    # Gates PERSISTENCE AND ADMIN READS, not in-process capture. Deliberately
    # narrower than "master switch" sounds: the recorder cannot read settings (it
    # must stay free of ``app.*`` imports so ``app/agents/`` can import it), and
    # the live channel debug feed's one-line no-match diagnosis is built from a
    # capture, so short-circuiting capture here would silently degrade a feature
    # that has nothing to do with storage. Off means no rows are written; the
    # per-request recording still runs and still feeds the debug panel.
    #
    # A READ gate as well. It was once consulted in exactly one place — the
    # persist path — so turning it off left the admin API happily serving up to
    # ``ROUTING_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`` of stored rows, message text included,
    # with no notice: the same asymmetry deliberately rejected for the text flag
    # below. Now the trace list comes back empty and a detail fetch 404s, each
    # carrying ``TRACING_DISABLED_NOTICE``.
    #
    # **It hides; it does not erase**, and ``DELETE /api/v1/admin/routing/traces``
    # deliberately KEEPS WORKING while this is off — otherwise the obvious first
    # move under privacy pressure would also remove the only way to delete the
    # rows already written.
    ROUTING_TRACE_ENABLED: bool = True
    # The one genuinely policy-bearing switch here. Server Channels otherwise
    # keeps inbound message text out of the database; a routing trace without
    # the message is close to useless for tuning, so it is stored — clamped,
    # TTL'd, superuser-only, and behind this flag. With it off, the trace still
    # carries ``message_sha256`` plus the candidate set and the verdict, which
    # is the diagnosis that matters most.
    #
    # **It reaches further than ``message_text``, and it is enforced by an
    # allowlist rather than an inventory.** With the flag off, the ``stages``
    # payload is projected through a list of explicitly-named safe fields
    # (``routing_trace.SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS``) on the write path *and* the read
    # path, from one definition so the two cannot drift. Anything not named
    # there is withheld by default — including fields added after this gate was
    # written, and including fields nobody realised had started carrying the
    # sender's words.
    #
    # That polarity is the whole design. This gate was enforced three times by
    # enumerating the tainted fields, and three times the enumeration turned out
    # to be one field short; sender text is a taint that *propagates* into new
    # fields through ordinary, reviewable-looking changes. An allowlist inverts
    # the question from "did we remember every field" — unanswerable — to "is
    # this field safe", which whoever adds a field can answer as they add it.
    # It also removed a privacy property that rested on the byte length of a
    # markdown template: gating on write means template length cannot create a
    # leak in either direction.
    #
    # Do not re-describe this gate by listing the fields it covers, here or
    # anywhere else. A list is a promise with an expiry date — that is precisely
    # what this comment used to be. Describe the mechanism; read
    # ``SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`` for the current contents.
    #
    # A READ gate as well as a write gate: with it off the admin API stops
    # serving the gated fields on rows already written, because an operator
    # turning this off means "stop showing me this text", not "stop appending to
    # the pile".
    #
    # **It hides; it does not erase.** Text captured before the flag went off
    # stays in the database. Exactly two things remove it: waiting out
    # ``ROUTING_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS``, or calling
    # ``DELETE /api/v1/admin/routing/traces``. Flipping this flag does NOT purge,
    # and that is deliberate — an accidental toggle would irreversibly destroy

    # free of ``app.*`` imports. Keep the two in step. Which stage fields those
    # are is the recorder's business and changes as it grows — see ``clamp()``'s

    # --- Server-channel inbound attachments ------------------------------

    # are bounded more tightly than a web upload: they arrive unattended, on
    # the platform's only unauthenticated ingress, and nobody is watching a
    # progress bar. These caps are the whole of the feature's bound — there
    # is deliberately no per-channel `allow_attachments` switch.

    # Per-file cap, deliberately BELOW the 100MB web-upload cap: 25MB is also
    # where most mail servers stop.

    # skipped WITHOUT being fetched — and, on email, without being *retained*

    # concurrency is derived from it (aggregate ÷ per-file), so a message's
    # true peak is roughly `aggregate + concurrency × per-file` — 100MB with
    # these defaults. Nothing caps that across *simultaneous* messages, so a

    # these thirty seconds, they do not get thirty each.

    # inside a webhook Google expects acked in about thirty seconds, and a
    # budget that scaled with the attachment count would miss the ack window
    # rather than drop a file. The cost is the tail of a large legitimate
