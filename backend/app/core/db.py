    """Yield a session holding a Postgres advisory lock, or ``None`` to skip.

    ``None`` means another process already holds ``lock_key`` and this run is
    not the leader. Under N gunicorn/uvicorn workers each runs its own
    ``BackgroundScheduler``, so without this guard every worker would run the
    same batch.

    **The lock has to live on the same physical connection for its whole life.**
    ``pg_try_advisory_lock`` is *connection*-scoped, while a ``Session`` bound to
    an **engine** hands its connection back to the pool at every ``commit()``.
    A sweep that commits per row would therefore strand the lock on a pooled
    connection: the matching ``pg_advisory_unlock`` runs on whatever connection
    the pool hands back next, returns false, and the lock is never released —
    so every subsequent run is locked out forever and the feature silently
    disables itself after its first productive run. Binding the ``Session`` to
    an explicit ``engine.connect()`` pins it.

    This is the ONLY implementation of that pattern. It was previously copied
    into three schedulers; two copies were correct, the third took the lock on a
    pooled session and leaked it exactly as described (a live bug), and each copy
    carried its own restatement of the reasoning above.

    Deliberately silent on the not-leader path: every caller already logs its
    own skip, with the context and at the level it wants (one of them names the
    bundle it was converging; another uses ``debug`` because it ticks every two
    minutes). A line here as well would double every one of them.

    Args:
        lock_key: A stable, arbitrary 64-bit key. Callers own their key and must
            not share one unless they genuinely must not run concurrently.
