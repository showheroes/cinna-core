"""Skills catalog API routes.

Two routers, one tag (so the generated client has a single ``SkillsService``):

* ``router`` — ``/skills/...``: the catalog itself. Browse, read a package,
  manage one you published, preview a revision's ``SKILL.md``, and the
  container-facing archive download.
* ``agent_router`` — ``/agents/{agent_id}/skills/...``: the two verbs that act
  on an agent rather than on the catalog — publish one of its skills, and add a
  catalog skill to it. They live here, with the catalog service, rather than in
  ``agent_skills.py`` (which is the Phase-2 read surface over the environment
  cache) because everything they touch is catalog state.

Errors come out of the service as :class:`SkillCatalogError` with a stable
code and are turned into responses by ``http_error_for``, which lives beside
the code → status map in ``app.services.skills.exceptions`` — shared with the
plugins router, so the same refusal cannot answer 400 on one route and 422 on
another.
