"""Admin routing API — traces, simulate, replay, recommendation drafts.

The durable half of routing observability. The channel debug buffer answers
"what just happened" for a few minutes in one worker; these routes answer "why
did it pick that" across restarts and workers, for the retention window.

Everything here requires ``get_current_active_superuser``. There is no
role-based partial access: a trace names the agents another account has
installed, the trigger prompts of agents the reader does not own, and — when
``ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT`` is on — an external sender's message text.
That is superuser-or-nothing, the same rule the channel administration surface
applies.

Read-only with respect to agents. Nothing on this router edits an agent, a
trigger prompt, or a bundle. The only writes are the traces themselves (a
simulate stores its own decision, which is what it returns), their deletion, and
the audit rows that record who ran what against whom.

Three of these routes spend a real LLM call per request and decide against
another account's live routing state. They share one set of conditions —
superuser-only, rate-limited on one per-admin bucket, and (for simulate and
replay) audited naming both the acting admin and the target. ``simulate``'s
docstring states plainly what that reach is and why it was not narrowed.

See ``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §6 and §12.

    Returns the same thing ``GET /admin/routing/traces/{id}`` returns — the
    same type, built by the same function — for a decision that was made and
    then not acted on. No thread binding, no session, no install, no outbound
    reply: ``ChannelRoutingService.decide`` cannot do any of those, which is
    why this is not a ``simulate=True`` flag threaded through the pipeline.

    **What this reveals, stated plainly so nobody discovers it later.** The
    response names the agents and bundles ``as_user_id`` has installed, their
    display names, their owners, and those owners' trigger prompts. Almost all
    of that is already in a stored ``routing_decision`` row the moment that user
    sends one message to a channel — what simulate removes is the *waiting*. It
    lets an admin enumerate the routing state of a user who has **never messaged
    the channel at all**, and that is genuinely new reach.

    It is deliberate reach. The narrowing that would remove it — restricting
    simulate to users who already have a channel binding — was considered and
    not adopted, because it would blunt the tool's main use: diagnosing the
    user whose *first* message failed to route, who by definition has no
    binding and no trace. So instead of narrowing, the reach is made
    accountable and non-bulk by the four conditions this route enforces:
    superuser-only; audited per call, naming the acting admin *and* the target;
    rate-limited per admin; and exposing exactly what a stored trace exposes and
    nothing more.

    That last one is not a matter of care. This route does not project anything
    itself — it hands back ``RoutingTraceService.get``'s output, so the
    message-text gate, the ``SAFE_STAGE_FIELDS`` allowlist and the name
    resolution apply here because they are the same code, not because they were
    reimplemented to match.

    **Naming a ``channel_id`` decides under that channel's real policy** rather
    than under ``ResolvedChannelPolicy.for_no_channel()``. That cuts both ways,
    and both ways matter to whoever reads the result.

    *It widens.* The no-channel policy holds ``allow_identity_routing`` False
    deliberately, so naming a channel is the only way a simulate can reproduce
    a ballot containing an identity candidate — a person who opted in to being
    routed to on that channel. Such a row carries that person's display name
    (their full name, falling back to their email), their ``owner_email``, a
    server-composed trigger prompt reading "Contact {name} ({email}). Routes to
    their available agents.", and — as ``prompt_examples`` — one line per
    example on each identity binding the target can reach, re-voiced as "ask
    {name} ({email}) to …". Those example lines are the third party's own
    binding wording, shown to an admin who is neither party.

    *It also narrows*, which is the half a reader will not expect. The resolved
    policy brings that channel's ``agent_scope`` and ``pinned_agent_id`` to
    bear and can switch ``allow_auto_install`` off, so a channel-named run can
    return **fewer** candidates than the same message run with no channel — down
    to a single pinned agent, or to none — and can bar Pass 2 entirely. A
    no-match under a channel is therefore not evidence of a no-match without
    one.

    Either way the reach is the reach a stored trace for that channel already
    has, and it stays inside the four conditions above; the audit row records
    the channel so a run can be told apart from one made without it.

    The advisory end of the feature, and the reason the whole admin surface can
    be read-only with respect to agents. When a foreign agent routes badly the
    output is wording its owner can apply — never an edit made on their behalf.
    Nothing on this route writes: not the agent, not the bundle, not the trace.

    ``ref_id`` names which candidate of *this trace* to draft for; with an
    obvious subject (the decision's own selection, or a sole candidate) it can
    be omitted. Restricted to this trace's candidates deliberately — an
    unrestricted form would be a "draft a trigger prompt for any agent" oracle
    hanging off a diagnostics endpoint.

    Rate-limited on the same bucket as simulate and replay: it runs a provider
    cascade per call like they do. Not audited, unlike them — it exposes nothing
    the caller did not already have from ``GET /traces/{id}``, and "writes
    nothing" is easier to keep true when it is literally true.
