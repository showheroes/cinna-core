"""Agent Skills + Addons API routes.

Routes:
  GET  /agents/{agent_id}/skills                  — cached skill index
  POST /agents/{agent_id}/skills/refresh          — wake + re-read, same shape
  GET  /agents/{agent_id}/skills/{name}/content   — one skill's SKILL.md text
  GET  /agents/{agent_id}/skills/{name}/files     — what one skill folder carries
  GET  /agents/{agent_id}/addons                  — plugins + skills, deduped
  POST /agents/{agent_id}/addons/refresh          — re-read, then re-project

All of them are owner-scoped. Reads are cache-first by design: the index is
env-authoritative but the environment may be asleep, and a card that renders
the last known skills beats one that blocks on a container start.

The addons routes live here rather than in ``agents.py`` because they read the
same environment cache these do; the composition itself is ``AddonsService``,
and this module only marshals it.
