"""Revoking a share also unlinks the recipient's agents (and re-syncs them).

A ``CredentialShare`` is the recipient's *right* to use a credential, but
nothing downstream re-checks it: ``get_agent_credentials`` joins
``AgentCredentialLink`` alone, so an agent linked to a shared credential keeps
receiving its value into every running container for as long as the link
exists. Deleting only the share row therefore revoked access on the credential
page while the recipient's container went on holding a working secret — found
by running the skill-credential scenario end to end on a dev stack
(docs/plans/skill_credential_requirements_plan.md §15, "Manual scenario run").

All revocation entry points now delete the recipient's links and sync their
environments:
  1. ``DELETE /credentials/{id}/shares/{share_id}`` — one recipient.
  2. ``PATCH /credentials/{id}/sharing`` with ``allow_sharing=false`` — all of
     them, while the owner's own links stay untouched.
  3. ``PUT /credentials/{id}`` with ``allow_sharing=false`` — the generic
     update path has the same revocation semantics as the dedicated control.

The env assertions use the adapter-capture pattern of
``test_credential_service_uri_env_sync.py``.
Legacy shares surviving an already-disabled flag are covered in
``tests/unit/test_credential_revocation_legacy.py``.
