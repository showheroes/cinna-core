"""Install readiness gate and setup endpoint tests for agent bundles.

Covers the pre-LLM gate (InstallReadinessGate), setup endpoints
(setup-status, setup-credentials), and the chat/MCP short-circuit behaviour
for installs that are not yet ready.

Scenarios (A/B/D/F/G assert readiness through GET /agents/{id}/setup-status,
which surfaces the same gate verdict that the runtime gate uses):
  A. setup-status — ready when no missing (fully-filled, owner-installed credential).
  B. setup-status — needs_setup with placeholder PBU credential.
  C. (moved) publisher_broken when PBP credential row missing — defensive
     DB-corruption branch, MagicMock unit test in
     tests/unit/test_install_readiness_gate_defensive.py.
  D. setup-status — publisher_broken when sharing revoked (allow_sharing=False).
  E. (moved) publisher AI credential row missing — defensive branch, same unit file as C.
  F. setup-status — publisher_broken when publisher AI share missing (AICredentialShare deleted).
  G. setup-status — publisher installs own bundle, no share needed → ready.
  H. GET /agents/{id}/setup-status — happy path (needs_setup install).
  I. GET /agents/{id}/setup-status — auth: another user gets 403/404.
  J. GET /agents/{id}/setup-credentials — returns only owner-placeholder creds.
  K. PUT /agents/{id}/setup-credentials/{credential_id} — happy path, flips is_placeholder.
  L. PUT /agents/{id}/setup-credentials/{credential_id} — rejected for non-placeholder creds.
  M. Chat short-circuit — placeholder install: system message persisted, LLM not engaged.
  N. MCP short-circuit — handle_send_message returns gate shape, not LLM.
  O. Chat gate-block still generates session title from user message.
  P. setup-status — an existing AICredentialShare for an admin-managed
     publisher AI credential is not reported at all.
  Q. setup-status — the same shape with NO share is also not reported: an
     admin-managed publisher credential never gates an install, because the
     install resolves the installer's own AI credential instead (paired with P,
     reached by the other branch).
  R. setup-status — a plain shareable publisher AI credential with no share
     still reports publisher_credential_unshared, which is what proves P and Q
     are not the gate having stopped reporting AI credentials at all.

A2A and webhook short-circuit tests are deferred (deep transport mocking needed).
Gate logic already validates the A2A/webhook channels — see scenarios A–G.

Direct DB access (``db`` fixture) is used only for credential mutation (breaking
PBP state after install) and reading back gate-level invariants.  All other setup
and assertion is through the API.
