"""The Socket.IO surface authenticates, and joins only rooms the caller owns.

The socket app is mounted publicly at ``/ws`` with ``cors_allowed_origins="*"``.
Before the fix these tests pin, ``connect`` read ``user_id`` out of the
client-supplied ``auth`` dict and joined that client to ``user_{user_id}`` with
no verification at all — so membership of a user's live event room (session
streams, task status changes, activities) was self-asserted by whoever could
reach the port. ``subscribe`` had the same gap one level down: it entered any
room by name.

Everything here goes over HTTP through the real mount using the polling
transport (``tests/utils/socket_client.py``), so these are ordinary API tests:
no handler closure is called directly, and a regression that breaks the ASGI
wiring fails them too.

Two properties are worth stating outright, because both are easy to
re-introduce:

1. **A client-supplied identity is ignored, not merely unverified.** The test
   below forges the ``user_id`` of a user who really exists, so it fails if the
   old shape is restored even partially — a check that only rejected
   *nonexistent* ids would pass a weaker test and still leak.
2. **There is no transition window.** ``{"user_id": ...}`` is refused outright
   rather than accepted alongside ``{"token": ...}``; an either-shape grace
   period would re-open the hole for exactly as long as it lasted, so the
   frontend change ships in the same commit.
