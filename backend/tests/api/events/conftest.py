"""Socket.IO / event-bus test fixtures.

Mirrors ``tests/api/agents/conftest.py``: the room-authorization tests need a
real agent and a real session, which go through the ordinary agent creation
flow and therefore need the same environment-adapter stub, background-task
collector and external-service mocks.

``patched_external_services`` replaces the *outbound* ``socketio_connector``
with a capturing stub; it does not touch the ``AsyncServer`` mounted at ``/ws``,
so ``connect`` / ``subscribe`` still run for real here.
