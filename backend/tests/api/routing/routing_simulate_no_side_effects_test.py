"""Simulate has no side effects — the safety property of Phase 3.

`POST /admin/routing/simulate` runs the real router over another user's real
routing state and then does *nothing* with the answer: no thread binding, no
session, no bundle install, no outbound reply. That is not enforced by a flag
threaded through the pipeline; `ChannelRoutingService.decide` cannot perform
any of those, and simulate calls only `decide`. These tests are what proves the
claim rather than restating it.

**Every absence here is asserted against durable state**, never against a log.
`caplog` is vacuous in this suite once Alembic's `fileConfig` has disabled the
app loggers, and the negative form (`assert x not in caplog.text`) then passes
forever against an empty string while reading, in review, exactly like a
careful absence proof. A no-side-effects assertion is the shape that invites
it. So:

  - **binding** — a direct `ChannelThreadBinding` count (documented exemption:
    bindings have no HTTP surface; `server_channels_pending_outbound_test.py`
    reads them the same way).
  - **session** — `GET /sessions/` as the target user.
  - **install** — `GET /agents/` as the target user.
  - **outbound reply** — the channel debug buffer read across *every* channel
    key (an outbound event is recorded for every real reply), plus the adapter
    `send_message` mock. Read across every key, not scoped to this test's
    channel: see `_outbound_events`, where the scoped version was found to be
    unfalsifiable.

**These assertions were mutation-checked, not merely written.** Four absences
is the easiest thing in this codebase to assert in a form that cannot fail. The
binding assertion was verified by making `decide` create a binding on purpose
and watching this file go red; the revert is recorded in the phase notes. If
you add an absence assertion here, break the thing it guards first.

**The simulate response is the stored trace read back, with one exception.**
It carries `guidance_reply` on top of `GET /traces/{id}`'s payload. That is
safe because the reply is composed only from ballot data the trace already
serves (`stages[].candidates`) or a fixed identity constant, never from the
sender's text; `test_simulate_response_is_the_stored_trace_read_back` pins the
difference to exactly that one key.
