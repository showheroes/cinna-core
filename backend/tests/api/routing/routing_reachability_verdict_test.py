"""The reachability verdict — plan §9's headline output, one test per branch.

`GET /admin/routing/traces/{id}` carries a `diagnosis`: one server-authored
sentence saying why the decision went this way and what to change, plus a
Jaccard near-miss ranking. `?expected_agent_id=` narrows it to "why was THIS
agent not a candidate", which is the question the tuning card is actually
opened to answer.

**Why every test here asserts the sentence, not just the code.** The wording
*is* the feature. A test that pinned only `code` would keep passing while the
sentence drifted into saying something false, and a wrong diagnosis about
somebody else's agent is worse than no diagnosis. So each test below pins the
exact text of the branch it exercises. That makes them deliberately brittle to
rewording, which is the intended trade: reword the verdict, update the test, and
the update is where somebody re-reads whether the new sentence is still true.

**The verdicts are split by origin** (`docs/application/routing_tuning/routing_tuning.md`
— *the verdict is split by origin for wording, never for findings*), so this
file is split the same way and the two halves are produced
differently — which is itself the thing worth understanding before editing here:

*Channel origins* (`server_channel`, and the `simulate`/`replay` of a channel
decision) are reached through a **real routing decision**: `POST
/admin/routing/simulate` runs the real router over the target's real state and
has no side effects. A verdict is a statement about what routing did, and a
fabricated trace would let it be right about a decision the router cannot
actually produce. Simulate rather than a webhook delivery because these branches
are about *routing state*, not delivery — same `ChannelRoutingService.decide`,
three fewer moving parts, no channel to set up. Where a branch needs
configuration that changed *after* the decision, the change is made between the
simulate and the read, which is the real-world shape of those branches too.

The one channel family simulate cannot reach is **a decision that took the
sender's answer to a question** (`match_method="clarified"`). It follows a
question row that only a webhook writes (simulate shows its question in
`guidance_reply` and stores nothing), so those tests deliver the question and
the reply through the real webhook. The question itself (`guided_clarify`) is
still a simulate, named under a channel that can ask.

*App MCP origins* are **seeded**, not simulated, and saying why is the point.
`AppMCPRoutingService.route_message` does open an `origin="app_mcp"` capture
now (phase 6 of `docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/` — this file used to
say nothing did, and that stopped being true), but simulate still cannot
produce one: `POST /admin/routing/simulate` runs the *channel* router. Reaching
a real App MCP decision from here would mean calling the MCP handler and
standing up a ballot, for branches whose answer comes from the database rather
than from the trace. So these use `seed_routing_trace`, the documented Rule-1
exemption in `tests/utils/routing.py`, and their candidate counts are all zero
because a seeded row has no candidate list. That the App MCP *capture* now
writes real rows — with a populated `channel_id`, under
`ROUTING_TRACE_APP_MCP_MODE` — is proved in
`tests/api/app_mcp/app_mcp_routing_trace_test.py`, not here. The App MCP
wording is unchanged by the scope split; these tests exist to prove it stayed
unchanged, not to re-derive it.

A third section, at the bottom, covers the remedy **profiles** themselves —
the generic arm an unmapped origin degrades to, and email's mapping onto the
channel arm. Both are seeded for the same reason App MCP is, and both are
failures that would otherwise be invisible: see that section's own header.

Branches that need a candidate list on a non-live origin, and skip reasons no
surface can produce any more (`identity_route`, `foreign_owner`, `agent_missing`
— see `routing_reachability_service`'s explanation tables), are pinned in
`tests/unit/test_routing_reachability.py`, which builds `RoutingDecisionPublic`
directly. Everything drivable is driven.

# producer that can be driven from here, and both are the kind that fails

# - **generic**, for an origin the map does not know. It replaced a default

# - **email**, which is mapped to the channel profile. That mapping is not a

#   and an email trace outside it loses `no_candidates_channel_scope` /
#   `no_candidates_auto_install_off` outright. The end-to-end proof over the
