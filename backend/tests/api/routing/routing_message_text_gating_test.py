"""`ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT` both ways, through the real channel path.

Every row this file produces is `origin="server_channel"`, and that is a
statement about this file rather than about the table: `simulate` and `app_mcp`
both have live producers now (`POST /admin/routing/simulate`;
`AppMCPRoutingService.route_message`, phase 6). The point stands unchanged —
`ROUTING_TRACE_STORE_MESSAGE_TEXT` is testable both ways through the channel
path, so proving the text gate needs no per-origin mode. That the same gate
holds on the App MCP origin, and that `ROUTING_TRACE_APP_MCP_MODE` narrows it
rather than re-opening it, is proved where that producer lives:
`tests/api/app_mcp/app_mcp_routing_trace_test.py`.

The property that matters most (plan §7): with the flag off, `message_text`
must be absent, but `message_sha256` must still be present — that residue is
what makes the trace usable for replay/dedupe even with text storage
disabled. Proven here by computing the expected hash independently
(`hashlib.sha256`) and asserting the stored value matches exactly, in BOTH
flag states, with the same input text — the hash must not itself depend on
whether the text is stored.

**The S5 gap this file used to have** (found auditing after a later dev pass
added `stages[].prompt` / `raw_response` gating): every test below —
and every other test in this domain that reaches Pass 2 — mocks
`AgentClassifier.classify` directly via `post_channel_message`'s
`classify_result` / `classify_side_effect`. That boundary sits ABOVE the only
code that ever calls `routing_trace.record_prompt` / `record_raw_response`
(inside `AgentClassifier.classify` itself, one layer further down). Mocking at
the higher boundary means those two stage fields are `None` for every trace
this suite ever produces, regardless of the flag — so a test asserting "prompt
is absent when the flag is off" was, and is, capable of passing against a
broken scrub (or a broken UN-scrub) because there was never a prompt to leak
in the first place.
`test_stage_prompt_and_raw_response_are_read_gated_by_store_message_text`
below closes that gap by mocking one layer deeper
(`app.services.routing.agent_classifier.get_provider_manager`), so the real
render/parse genuinely runs and genuinely populates both fields before the
gate is exercised against them.

Both targets moved in Phase 5, which unified three copies of the candidate
builder behind `AgentClassifier`: the classifier boundary was
`AIFunctionsService.route_to_agent` and the provider seam was
`app.agents.app_agent_router.get_provider_manager`.

       `prompt` and a real `raw_response` naming the chosen bundle.
    2. Read that row back with the flag still ON: both fields are visible.
    3. Read the SAME row with the flag now OFF: both are scrubbed to `None`

       the same text again.

    **Why this doesn't assert the raw message text is IN the stored
    `prompt`** (a first draft of this test did, and it failed — not a
    production bug): the recorder clamps every free-text field to

    is ever consulted, and `app_agent_router_prompt.md` — the static template
    prefixed onto every rendered prompt — is already ~2300 chars on its own.
    So the stored `prompt` is always a truncated slice of the static template
    text; the "## User Message" section holding the sender's actual words is
    appended AFTER the template and never survives the clamp. That is a
    genuine, load-bearing fact about this feature's exposure profile (the
    trace is clamped independent of the flag), not a test bug to work around
    by asserting less. What this test instead does to prove the REAL
    function ran (not a higher-layer classify-result mock) is inspect the
    mock's own `call_args` — the unclamped prompt actually handed to the LLM

    `llm_attempts[].error` are not — and the difference is not a matter of
    taste. The first two are the **agent owner's** configuration, which nothing
    the sender types can reach; the last three are the sender's own words, or a
    rewrite of them. Plan §7 admits the pair for exactly that reason (§9's
    near-miss verdict scores a Jaccard overlap against the trigger prompt, so
    withholding it degraded a diagnosis unrelated to sender privacy).

    Proved through the API, by execution, against a trace that genuinely
    carries all five fields — never by reading `SAFE_CANDIDATE_FIELDS` back,
    which would pass just as happily against a projection that ignores it.

    **Pass 1, over two owned agents.** Two rather than one is load-bearing,
    not cosmetic: a single eligible agent with an empty auto-install list takes
    Pass 1's `only_one` short-circuit and never renders a prompt at all, so the
    very fields this test is about would not exist. A second eligible agent
    makes the ballot a real one and forces the classifier to run. The provider patch is
    `app.services.routing.agent_classifier.get_provider_manager` —
    the depth the S5 test above established — so the real classifier runs
    and the real `record_prompt` / `record_raw_response` fire. The provider stub
    also calls `record_llm_attempt` itself, standing in for
    `ProviderManager._note_attempt` (which the patch replaces), with a marker in
    `error` playing an SDK exception that echoed the request payload back.

    Both flag directions, because they prove different things and neither
    implies the other:

      1. **Write path** — captured with the gate OFF, read back with it ON, so
         the read projection cannot be what is doing the hiding. The owner's two
         fields must have been *stored*; the sender-derived three must not.
      2. **Read path** — captured with the gate ON (all five stored), read with
         it OFF. The owner's two must still be served; the sender-derived three
         must not.
