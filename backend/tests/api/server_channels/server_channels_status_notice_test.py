"""The thread status notice — one message that narrates and then leaves.

What this replaces: a notice per pipeline state. "Got it — finding the right
assistant", "Setting up X for you", "Your assistant is ready" — three permanent
messages sitting above the one thing the person asked for, on every first
contact, forever.

Google Chat gives an app ``spaces.messages.patch`` over its **own** posts, so
the whole narration can instead be one message that is rewritten in place — and
whose *last* rewrite is the agent's own reply. The notice does not disappear
when the answer arrives; it becomes the answer.

That last part is a correction, and the reason it matters is visible to every
reader of the thread. The first version deleted the notice after posting the
reply beneath it, and Chat renders a deleted message as a **"Message deleted by
its author"** tombstone — so every single answer arrived under one. Reusing the
slot removes deletion from the common path entirely, which is also why
``supports_status_notice`` derives from edit alone;
``supports_message_delete`` gates only the two edges that end a turn with
nothing to say.

Three verbs:

* **set** — post it, or rewrite it. The id is kept on the binding.
* **settle** — rewrite it one last time and let go of the id, for a text that
  IS the answer ("nothing matched", "setup failed"). The message stays.
* **clear** — delete it. The exception, not the happy path: a stream that
  produced no message, and a routing race whose loser's notice has no thread
  left to narrate.

And the delivery itself, ``_deliver(into_status_notice=True)``, writes the
agent's reply into the slot via ``replace_message`` — chunked, unlike a notice
rewrite, since an agent's answer can be any length: the first chunk takes the
slot and the remainder is posted after it.

The consequence worth naming, because it is what the assertions below are
mostly about: an accepted message now acks the webhook in **silence**. The
narration moved out of the sync response because Chat creates that message but
never tells us its id — a notice answered synchronously can be neither
rewritten nor removed, which is precisely what this feature needs to do.

Markdown translation on the way out (`**bold**` → `*bold*`, which is why
`REPLY_INSTALLING` renders at all) happens *inside* the adapter, below the
mock used here; it is covered in `tests/unit/test_google_chat_format.py` and
`tests/unit/test_google_chat_sync_response.py`.
