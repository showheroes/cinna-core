"""Turn identity — a turn's reply is the message *that turn wrote*, never the
newest agent row in the session.

The bug this file is the reproducer for shipped, and it was not theoretical:
``ChannelOutboundService.handle_stream_completed`` resolved its text with
``_last_agent_message`` — "the newest ``role='agent'`` row in this session by
sequence number" — which answers a question about the *session*, not about the
*turn*. A turn that writes no agent row at all therefore re-delivered the
**previous** turn's answer into the thread, as if it were the reply to the new
message. Two shapes reach that state today:

* a **command turn** (``/run:<name>``) — the command stream writes one
  ``role="system"`` message and never an agent row;
* a **batch with no storable events** — ``streaming_events`` stays empty, the
  finalize block is skipped, and no row is created.

(A *tool-only* batch is **not** one of them, despite being the obvious guess:
``message_service`` gives such a batch the literal ``"Agent response"``
placeholder, so it does write a row. Channel delivery no longer sends that
placeholder — the uuid arm detects the tool-only shape from the row's stored
events and delivers a compact tool summary instead; see
``channel_tool_summary.py`` and ``tests/unit/test_channel_tool_summary.py``.)

The fix is turn identity in the terminal stream events'
meta — ``agent_message_id``, the row the batch wrote or an explicit ``None`` —
and consumers that deliver exactly that row. Layered on top is the
``channel_turn_delivery`` ledger: one durable row per external message a turn
put on screen, which makes a duplicate completion idempotent and turns the
relay-versus-finalized-text assumption into a check that can fire.

What is asserted here, and where the rest lives:

* Everything a **reader** sees goes through the four Google Chat verbs, the
  ``_Chat`` shape this domain shares (see the README's "Patterns specific to
  this domain": a test that wants real notice behaviour must mock all four,
  because a mocked ``send_message`` cannot return a usable id and every state
  would degrade to a fresh post).
* The **ledger's own** contract — which rows exist, what they are attributed
  to, which one is ``final``, which one is ``diverged`` — is invisible from
  the thread by construction (the divergence check is deliberately
  observational and delivers nothing either way), so it is read straight off
  the table through ``tests/utils/server_channel.py::list_turn_deliveries``,
  a read-only Rule-1 exemption in the same narrow spirit as
  ``get_binding_status_message_id``.
* The emitter's own meta and the consumer's branch matrix are pure logic and
  are unit-tested next door: ``tests/unit/test_stream_turn_identity_meta.py``
  and ``tests/unit/test_channel_turn_identity_consumer.py``. The ledger's
  totality (a failed write never raises into a delivery) is
  ``tests/unit/test_channel_turn_delivery_ledger.py``; the relay's own
  boundary bookkeeping is ``tests/unit/test_channel_stream_relay.py``.

``handle_stream_error`` / ``handle_stream_interrupted`` gained **no** consumer
behaviour change in this feature and must not acquire one — their branches are
the previous feature's shipped regression guards. What they gained is a ledger
close-out in a ``finally``, and the interrupted scenarios below exist to prove
that close-out changed none of the five branches it now sits under.
