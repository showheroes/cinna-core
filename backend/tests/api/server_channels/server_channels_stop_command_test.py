"""``/stop`` — the one thing a sender types *at the pipeline*, not at the agent.

A chat thread has nowhere to render the web client's stop button, so the stop
is a word. ``channel_control_commands`` is a registry of exactly one entry
today, and ``ChannelInboundService.process_inbound`` consults it at step 7a —
**after** per-asker binding lookup and every security gate, which is
the whole authorization argument for calling ``MessageService.interrupt_stream``
without re-deriving access (that method's documented contract is "the caller
authorizes"). Invariant 6 of the plan is precisely that ordering, and it is
pinned here by a second asker's first ``/stop`` leaving the existing session
untouched, then their next ``/stop`` targeting only their own bound session.

The second half of the file is the **acknowledgement**: a successful ``/stop``
deliberately replies nothing, because ``ChannelOutboundService
.handle_stream_interrupted`` settles the thread's status notice with whatever
the agent had already said plus a stopped marker, and that message *is* the
answer. Four shapes of stopped turn are covered, and they are not
interchangeable — two of them shipped as bugs in opposite directions against a
fully green suite, because every pre-existing test drove a relay that had
produced text:

* the agent had said something → partial answer, marker under it;
* **the agent had said nothing at all** — the likeliest stop there is, and the
  one that stranded the spinner;
* the relay had already sealed everything it held → the marker as its own
  message, below the sealed text (the shape that settled a bare marker over a
  live draft);
* the thread was never narrating → **silence**, because posting into a thread
  that was showing nothing is worse than saying nothing.

Every assertion below is on what reaches the thread through the four adapter
verbs, never on relay internals, so a refactor of that seam does not have to
edit this file to keep it honest.

Matching itself (``"/stop"`` vs ``" /STOP "`` vs ``"/stopx"``) is pure string
logic; the API surface here exercises the normalized and the plain form and
leaves the rest to the module's own unit coverage.
