"""Routing + binding lifecycle — plan §13 checklist.

Covers:
  - Pass 1 (the sender's own agents) match, on a standalone agent with no
    `AppAgentRoute` at all — the shape that used to be invisible to routing.
    (`AppAgentRoute` is deleted entirely as of phase 5 of
    `docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/`, so every agent is now this
    shape; the phrase is kept because it names the historical failure mode
    this test guards, not a distinction that still exists.)
  - Pass 1 candidate scoping (`ChannelCandidateProvider`): an identity contact
    is absent from the ballot entirely, and an owned agent with nothing to
    classify on is a recorded skip. Two tests that proved a *route* leaking
    into or gating the ballot — a foreign agent reachable only through an
    admin-route assignment, and a route's `channel_app_mcp`/`is_active`
    toggles — are deleted with the mechanism they guarded: there is no route
    left that could leak or gate. `channel_routing_scope_test.py` (an
    architecture test) now holds the corresponding guarantee structurally —
    neither `channel_routing_service.py` nor `channel_candidate_provider.py`
    may import the App MCP routing surface at all.
  - Pass 1's two remaining post-classification guards, both unreachable
    through the real call graph and pinned by forging a candidate: the
    ownership postcondition that keeps an external Google Chat sender out of
    a stranger's workspace, and a candidate whose row has vanished.
  - Pass 2 candidate filtering: visibility (a private/ungranted bundle on the
    auto-install list is never a candidate), already-installed exclusion,
    missing-trigger-prompt exclusion.
  - No-match reply when neither pass finds anything.
  - Binding self-heal: a `failed` binding is deleted and re-routed by the
    next message from its own owner.
  - Session-deleted recovery: `session_id` SET NULL -> next message opens a
    fresh session on the same bound agent.

    This is the incident's actual shape (plan §1): Gemini picked the identity
    route at confidence 0.8, and Pass 1 rejected it only *after* the decision
    had already been spent on it — an identity contact was on the ballot at
    all. `ChannelCandidateProvider.build` only ever queries
    `Agent.owner_id == user_id`, so an identity contact cannot enter the set
    by construction, but nothing pinned that until now.

    "Absent entirely" is checked two ways, both stronger than "skipped after
    the classifier ran": no `identity_stage2` stage exists on a channel trace
    at all (the Stage-2 handoff Pass 1 used to make is gone, not merely made
    to lose), and the identity agent never appears as a candidate — eligible
    or skipped — on any stage that does run.

    The identity binding is set up so that it is genuinely reachable on the
    identity surface: assigned to the sender by its owner, then switched on by
    the sender themself (`toggle_identity_contact` — there is no superuser-free
    switch on this surface, unlike the App MCP admin route above). The point
    of this test is that "reachable" on the identity surface must still mean
    "absent" on the channel one.

    **Read the precondition, which became load-bearing in phase 3 of the
    channels & identity unification and was merely incidental before it.** This
    sender has no `channel_user_setting` row, so `allow_identity_routing`
    resolves to its `false` default and `ChannelRoutingService` does not call
    `IdentityCandidateProvider` at all. Identity *can* now reach a channel
    ballot — that is the feature — and what stays true here is the narrower
    statement this test was always making: nothing on the identity surface
    alone puts a person on a channel ballot; only the sender's own
    channel-level opt-in does. The switched-on counterpart, and the trace-level
    proof that the switch is what decides it, are in
