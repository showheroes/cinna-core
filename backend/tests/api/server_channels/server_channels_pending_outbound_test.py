"""Pending flow + outbound delivery — plan §13 checklist.

Covers:
  - Parking a message while an auto-installed environment builds.
  - `flush_pending_bindings` (called directly — see `tests/utils
    /server_channel.py::flush_pending_bindings` and the domain README for why)
    advancing a `pending_install` binding to `active` and delivering the
    parked message once the environment reports `running`.
  - The env-failure path: `status == "error"` fails the binding and notifies
    the thread, and does NOT advance it.
  - `STREAM_COMPLETED` outbound gating: a non-channel session's completion
    must never reach the channel adapter (the cheap
    `integration_type.startswith("channel_")` gate); a channel session's
    completion must deliver the final assistant message through the binding.

Chunking (`GoogleChatAdapter._chunk`) is pure text-splitting logic with no
I/O and is unit-tested instead, not here — see
`tests/unit/test_google_chat_adapter_chunk.py`.

    Regression: a message could be dropped in silence after a failed drain.

    `_flush_one` commits `active` BEFORE draining, so a drain that fails leaves
    an ACTIVE binding still holding its parked queue. The next inbound message
    then re-parks at the back of that queue rather than overtaking it — and
    when the queue is already at `_MAX_PARKED_MESSAGES`, `_append_parked`
    refuses. That refusal used to be discarded: the message was gone and the
    sender was told nothing, left waiting for an answer that could never come.

    `_park_message` has held the opposite invariant all along ("never drop in
    silence"), and this path must match it. The reply travels out-of-band via
    the adapter, not in the webhook response, because an ACTIVE binding is
    acked silently — which is precisely why a dropped message here was
    invisible.

    The drain is failed by making the ingest call raise, with the environment
    left `running`. Failing the environment instead would take the binding
    down a different path (`_flush_one` fails it outright) and never reach the
    re-park at all.
