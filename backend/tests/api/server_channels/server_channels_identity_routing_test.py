"""Identity over channels — the HR story, end to end (plan phase 3 §4).

> HR shares their identity and exposes one agent behind it. A colleague enables
> that identity and switches identity routing on for the channel. From Google
> Chat they write "hey, ask HR what is my time-off status?". Routing finds
> nothing among the sender's own agents, finds HR on the ballot, hands off to
> Stage 2, and opens a session **on HR's agent, in HR's workspace** — with the
> reply going back to the sender's own Google Chat thread.

What this file pins, and why each one is here rather than assumed:

  - **The route and the reply, as one story.** The reply half looks redundant
    next to "it routed" and is not: ``ChannelOutboundService
    ._resolve_channel_session`` gates on ``integration_type.startswith
    ("channel_")``, so an identity-routed session stamped ``identity_mcp``
    would route correctly, answer correctly, and silently never deliver. That
    is a failure that looks like success everywhere except in this assertion.
  - **The one-candidate short-circuit**, which is the HR story's simplest
    shape and a separate code path from the classifier branch: a sender who
    owns no agents and can reach exactly one identity owner routes with **no
    classifier call at all** (``_route_only_candidate`` dispatches Stage 2
    directly). Every test below names no classifier answer, so the suite's
    refusal stub fails loudly if that short-circuit ever stops firing.
  - **Every later message in the thread.** The second message is what
    ``_verify_resume_sender``'s identity exception was relaxed for, and the
    scenario that regresses to "permanently refused" if the exception is ever
    tightened back.
  - **That exception's own condition**, forged rather than driven, because no
    production path can reach it — see ``verify_resume_sender``'s docstring in
    ``tests/utils/server_channel.py``.
  - **Session visibility, per surface**, pinned on all three so the divergence
    (``GET /sessions/`` is owner-scoped, ``GET /external/sessions`` matches
    ``identity_caller_id`` too) is a decision on record rather than a future
    bug report.
  - **Per-asker isolation** — two people in one conversation receive their
    independently routed sessions, including an identity session owned by a
    third person. Queueing both before routing must preserve this separation.
  - **An absent grant still bites.** The recovery branch in
    ``ChannelInboundService._ingest`` deliberately re-creates a session with no
    grant, and on a foreign agent that must be refused rather than repaired.

Revocation, consent withdrawal and the audit row live in
``server_channels_identity_revocation_test.py``; what the trace does and does
not record lives in ``server_channels_identity_trace_test.py``.

    """No grant, foreign agent ⇒ `PermissionError` before anything is written.

    This is the recovery branch `ChannelInboundService._ingest` documents and
    deliberately does NOT repair: HR deletes the session, the FK nulls
    `binding.session_id`, and the next message arrives on an `active` binding
    naming HR's agent with **no routing decision behind it**. Re-deriving a
    grant from the binding would be inventing an authorization the routing
    layer never issued, so `assert_access` falls through to the three-way owner
    invariant (`agent.owner_id == expected_owner_id == sender.platform_user_id`)
    and refuses.

    The observable consequences, all three asserted: the generic setup-failed
    reply, no session created in HR's workspace, and a binding left in a state
    that self-heals rather than one that wedges — the message after it
    re-routes and opens a genuinely fresh, freshly-verified identity session.
