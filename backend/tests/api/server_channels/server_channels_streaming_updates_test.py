"""The status notice, streaming — one message that grows while the agent writes.

Before this feature a Google Chat turn was silent for as long as the agent
worked: the notice said "💬 Working on your message…" and then the whole reply
arrived at once. ``channel_stream_relay`` tees off the same stream the web
client watches and rewrites that one message every few seconds with the text
accumulated so far, so the reader watches the answer appear instead of watching
a spinner. When the draft grows past what one Chat message can hold it is
**sealed** — left standing, finished — and a fresh draft opens below it.

What this file is for, and what it deliberately is not: the relay's own
decisions (debounce, seal arithmetic, tail idempotency, fence re-opening) are
pure logic and are unit-tested in ``tests/unit/test_channel_stream_relay.py``
and ``tests/unit/test_chat_text_chunking.py``. Everything here is the
**integration**: a real webhook delivery, a real routing decision, a real
session, the real outbound service, and the four Google Chat verbs mocked at
the adapter boundary — the same seam ``server_channels_status_notice_test.py``
uses, and the same ``_Chat`` shape. What is asserted is only what a person
reading the thread would see.

Two facts about the harness that are load-bearing enough to state up front:

* **``CHANNEL_STREAM_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 0``.** The setting documents
  ``<= 0`` as "flush immediately on every event", which exists precisely so a
  test never has to sleep to watch a draft update. It is set through
  ``patch.object(settings, ...)``, the override pattern this directory already
  uses for ``UPLOAD_BASE_PATH`` and ``CHANNEL_ATTACHMENT_MAX_FILE_MB``.

* **``_LiveStream``, and why ``StubAgentEnvConnector`` alone is not enough.**
  The relay's flusher is a *sibling asyncio task*: it can only run when the
  streaming coroutine yields to the event loop. A real SSE stream yields on
  every network read; ``StubAgentEnvConnector`` yields its canned events with
  no ``await`` between them, so under it the loop never gets a turn and the
  draft is never patched — the whole answer lands in one piece and every
  assertion below would pass vacuously by measuring the *old* behaviour. The
  subclass here inserts an explicit ``_PAUSE`` marker where the test author
  wants the reader to see a redraw; it is not a hack around the relay, it is
  the one thing the canned stub does not model about a network.

Interrupted turns — what the thread is shown when a stream is *stopped* rather
than completed — live next door in ``server_channels_stop_command_test.py``,
because the acknowledgement is what makes ``/stop`` visible.
