"""
Integration tests for task lifecycle activity creation.

Tests that TASK_STATUS_UPDATED events correctly create and dismiss Activity records
for task status transitions. Also tests the session activity gap fix — that
session_completed activities are always created regardless of connection status.

Scenarios:
  1. Task lifecycle activities — blocked, unblocked, cancelled, completed
  2. task_blocked deduplication — blocked twice without unblocking → only one activity
  3. session activities always created — is_read=True when user connected, is_read=False when disconnected
  4. archive_logs endpoint + is_archived filtering — archive hides logs, include_archived restores them
  5. ActivityPublicExtended task fields — task_short_code, task_title, agent_id populated
  6. Session activity task link — session_completed carries input_task_id from source task
