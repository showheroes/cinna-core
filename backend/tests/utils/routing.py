"""Helpers for Auto Routing Tuning API tests (`tests/api/routing/`).

Most of this domain is plain HTTP wrappers around
``GET/DELETE /api/v1/admin/routing/traces``. Two functions below are
documented Rule-1 exemptions, mirroring the shape already established in
``tests/utils/server_channel.py`` (``flush_pending_bindings`` /
``route_installed``) — each covers functionality that genuinely has no HTTP
surface, by design:

1. ``purge_routing_traces`` — ``RoutingTraceService.purge`` is invoked by
   ``routing_trace_scheduler``, which (like every other scheduler in this
   project) is gated behind ``settings.TESTING`` and never runs in tests.
   There is no admin route that triggers a purge on demand; tests call the
   service method directly instead of racing a background thread.

2. ``seed_routing_trace`` — ``RoutingDecision.created_at`` is server-assigned
   at persist time and there is no route that lets a caller backdate a
   decision. That is deliberate (forging a trace's timestamp has no
   legitimate use), which also means it is the *only* way to test
   ``purge``'s ``created_at < cutoff`` boundary. It is also still the only
   way to produce an ``identity`` row — nothing opens a capture with that
   origin, and by ruling nothing will: identity is a *stage* inside another
   surface's decision. Neither ``simulate`` nor ``app_mcp`` is in that list
   any more: ``POST /admin/routing/simulate`` and ``.../replay`` emit the
   first for real, and ``AppMCPRoutingService.route_message`` emits the
   second (phase 6 of ``docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/``), so a
   test wanting a row on either should drive the surface rather than seed
   one — ``tests/api/app_mcp/app_mcp_routing_trace_test.py`` does. Seeding an
   ``app_mcp`` row is still legitimate where the *shape* of the row is the
   fixture rather than the thing under test, but note it now passes through
   ``ROUTING_TRACE_APP_MCP_MODE``: at the default ``metadata`` the seeded row
   comes back without its ``message_text``, and at ``off`` it is not written
   at all. Pin the mode around the seed if the test cares.
   Builds a real ``RoutingTrace``
   through the recorder (so ``message_sha256`` etc. are computed the same
   way production computes them), then backdates ``created_at`` before
   handing it to ``RoutingTraceService.persist``.

   Takes no ``db`` parameter: ``persist`` opens its own short-lived session
   (see its docstring — a diagnostic write must never borrow the caller's
   transaction), and that session is already routed onto the test
   transaction by the domain conftest's ``patch_create_session`` fixture
   (``CREATE_SESSION_TARGETS_AGENT`` includes
   ``routing_trace_service.create_session``). An earlier draft of this
   helper accepted ``db`` and never used it — a signature that lied about
   what makes the write land in the test transaction.

    Phase 5 collapsed three hand-built candidate lists into it; before that the
    single boundary was ``AIFunctionsService.route_to_agent``, which is now a
    ``list[dict]`` adapter over the same code and is no longer on the routing
    path.

    **Naming an answer is mandatory.** Passing neither argument patches the
    classifier to raise (:func:`refuse_to_classify`): it used to leave it
    unpatched, which meant the default behaviour of this helper was to call a
    live model. Sixteen call sites took that default.

    What the guard's first run measured is worth writing down, because it is
    not what "sixteen unstubbed call sites" sounds like: none of the sixteen
    actually invokes the classifier today — every one of those scenarios
    short-circuits before it (a single effective route, or an empty candidate
    list). They were not calling a model; they were one setup change away from
    it, silently. The live calls this domain has actually made came from
    elsewhere: ``generate_router_trigger_prompt`` (see
    ``patched_trigger_prompt_draft``) and a Phase-5 measurement run that
    exhausted a provider quota.

    ``classify_no_match=True`` is therefore a separate flag rather than
    ``classify_result=None``: ``None`` is the "you have not said" case, and a
    scenario that needs the classifier to *run and find nothing* — the whole
    no-match family — has to be able to say so. Naming it also makes the intent
    readable at the call site, which "return_value=None" is not.

    Yields the ``send_message`` mock. Asserting it was never called is one half
    of "simulate sent no reply" — the durable half is that no binding and no
    debug-feed outbound event exist either, which is what the no-side-effects
    test actually leans on.
