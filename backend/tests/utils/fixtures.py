# ── Classifier provider guard (routing tests cannot reach a real model) ─────
#
# `AgentClassifier.classify` is the single classifier behind every routing
# consumer (Channel Pass 1 / Pass 2, App MCP Stage 1, Identity Stage 2), and it
# calls a REAL provider cascade unless a test stubs it. The test environment has
# a live, configured cascade (`get_provider_manager().is_available()` is True in
# the container), so "unstubbed" means "dials out", not "fails fast".
#
# It has already cost a run: a Phase-5 measurement exhausted a Gemini quota, and
# the resulting 429s read as an unrelated suite going red — the failure mode
# that teaches people to re-run instead of investigate.
#
# The guard is installed globally (see the `block_llm_provider` autouse fixture
# in `tests/conftest.py`) at the classifier's own provider seam, so a test that
# forgets to stub fails with an explanation instead of making a network call —
# in a domain nobody has thought to protect yet as much as in this one.
#
# **Scope, stated precisely because it is narrower than it looks.** This patches
# ONE name: `agent_classifier.get_provider_manager`. The classifier is guardable
# by a single patch only because Phase 5 gave it that wrapper. The other twelve
# AI functions (`title_generator`, `description_generator`, `agent_generator`,
# `router_trigger_prompt_generator`, ...) each do
# `from .provider_manager import get_provider_manager` at import time, so they
# hold their own binding and patching the source module is a no-op for them —
# `AIFunctionsService.generate_router_trigger_prompt` in particular is still
# documented as reaching a live provider if a test lets it (use
# `tests.utils.routing.patched_trigger_prompt_draft`). The single chokepoint
# that would cover all of them is `ProviderManager.generate_content`; extending
# the guard there is a strictly larger change than this one, because it would
# turn every currently-unstubbed AI-function test red at once and needs a
# full-suite run to size. Deliberately not done here.

    webhook (`ChannelRoutingService._route_installed`'s
    ``except Exception ... # noqa: BLE001``, and `AgentClassifier.classify`'s
    own catch-all). An `Exception` here would therefore be caught by the code
    under test, recorded as a routing error, and reported to the test as an
    ordinary no-match — the failure would be invisible, which is the exact
    condition this guard exists to end. `BaseException` passes straight through
