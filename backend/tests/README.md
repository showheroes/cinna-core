# Backend Testing

## Running Tests

```bash
make test-backend
```

This executes `docker compose exec backend python -m pytest tests/ -v` inside the running backend container.

Prerequisites:
- Docker services must be running (`make up` or `docker compose up -d`)
- The `app_test` database must exist in the `db` container (created automatically on first `docker compose up` by `scripts/create-test-db.sh`)
- If the database was created before the init script was added, create it manually once:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE app_test;"
  ```

## Architecture

### API-Only Integration Tests

All tests interact with the backend **exclusively through HTTP requests** using FastAPI's `TestClient`. No test imports from `app.crud`, `app.services`, or `app.core.security` are allowed.

This means:
- **Setup**: Create users via `POST /users/signup`, create items via `POST /items/`, etc.
- **Verification**: Check API responses, verify side-effects by logging in with new credentials or fetching resources via API endpoints -- not by querying the database directly.
- **No direct DB access**: Tests do not import `Session`, `select`, or any ORM/CRUD functions.

By hitting only the API surface, each test implicitly covers:
1. Route registration and URL matching
2. Dependency injection (auth, DB sessions)
3. Request parsing and validation (Pydantic/SQLModel schemas)
4. Business logic in services and CRUD layers
5. Database queries and transactions
6. Response serialization and status codes
7. Authentication and authorization guards

### Separate Test Database

Tests run against a dedicated PostgreSQL database (`app_test`), not the application database (`app`). This is configured via environment variables passed to the backend container in `docker-compose.override.yml`:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST_DB_SERVER` | `db` | Hostname of the Postgres container |
| `TEST_DB_PORT` | `5432` | Port |
| `TEST_DB_NAME` | `app_test` | Test database name |
| `TEST_DB_USER` | `${POSTGRES_USER}` | Same user as the main DB |
| `TEST_DB_PASSWORD` | `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` | Same password as the main DB |

These are read by `app.core.config.Settings` and assembled into `TEST_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`. The test engine in `conftest.py` connects to this URI. If `TEST_DB_SERVER` is not set, pytest fails immediately with a clear error.

### Automatic Migrations

Before any test runs, the session-scoped `setup_db` fixture in `conftest.py`:
1. Runs `alembic upgrade head` against the **test database** (not the app database)
2. Seeds the superuser via `init_db()`

This ensures the test database schema is always up to date with the latest migrations. Alembic's `env.py` respects a `sqlalchemy.url` set on the config object, which the fixture sets to the test DB URI before calling `command.upgrade`.

**`caplog` assertions are vacuous for the rest of the session.** `app/alembic/env.py` calls
`logging.config.fileConfig(config.config_file_name)` on every `command.upgrade` run, and that
call's default is `disable_existing_loggers=True`. Every application logger that already existed
at that point comes back with `disabled = True` — for the remaining life of the test session, not
just for the migration. Since `setup_db` runs this before anything else, an assertion like
`assert "some message" in caplog.text` is comparing against `""` and passes whether or not the
message was ever logged. This was caught when a draft assertion failed to fail — same detection
mode as a mutation check. Exposure drifts as files are added, so don't trust a number recorded
here — re-measure it yourself: `grep -rl caplog backend/tests/` for which files touch `caplog` at
all, then `grep -rn "in caplog\.\(text\|records\)" backend/tests/` for which of those actually
assert on it (an `at_level(...)` block with no following `caplog.text`/`caplog.records` check is
inert, not exposed). A clean grep is a statement about the past tense only — it says no one has
hit the trap *yet*, not that no one can; treat it as a reason to re-check before adding the next
`caplog` assertion, not as a guarantee. If you need to assert on a log, don't use `caplog`: attach a
handler directly to the logger under test and set `logger.disabled = False` first — see
`_swallowed_failures` in the file above for a working pattern. Better still, avoid log-text
assertions altogether and assert on observable behavior instead (a returned value, a persisted
row, the *type* of an exception a guard swallowed) — log assertions are brittle even when they
technically work.

**Under this trap, positive caplog assertions fail honestly; negative ones lie.**
`assert x in caplog.text` against `""` fails, loudly and immediately — annoying, but
self-announcing, and that is exactly how three assertions of this shape in
`tests/unit/test_channel_reply_instrumentation.py` were caught (they passed alone, then failed the
moment a file exercising `setup_db`, such as anything under `tests/architecture/`, ran first in the
same session). `assert x not in caplog.text` against `""` **passes vacuously, in every scope,
forever** — there is no run in which it can fail, whether or not the code it claims to guard is
even present. It reads in review as a careful test proving something is absent, and it is proving
nothing. The three failures above were only caught because the author happened to write the
positive form; a negative form of the same mistake would still be green today. Treat this as a
rule, not a coincidence: never write `not in caplog.text` (or `not in caplog.records`) as a
regression guard, and be suspicious of any existing one — it cannot have failed a mutation check,
so its presence proves nothing about whether it was ever checked.

### Transaction Isolation (Savepoint Pattern)

Every test runs inside a database transaction that is **rolled back** after the test completes. This is implemented using the SQLAlchemy savepoint pattern:

1. `db` fixture opens a connection and begins an outer transaction
2. The `Session` is constructed with `join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` — SQLAlchemy 2.0's documented mode for a `Session` joining an externally-managed connection/transaction via SAVEPOINTs (see the comment on the `Session(...)` construction in `conftest.py` for the bug this fixes and why the default mode doesn't pick it automatically here)
3. A nested savepoint is created inside that transaction
4. When app code calls `session.commit()`, it commits the savepoint (not the outer transaction)
5. An `after_transaction_end` event listener re-creates the savepoint after each commit
6. After the test, the outer transaction is rolled back, undoing **all** changes

This means:
- Every test starts with a clean slate (only the seeded superuser exists)
- Tests never affect each other, regardless of execution order
- No manual cleanup is needed
- The `client` fixture overrides FastAPI's `get_db` dependency to inject the test session

**What `session.rollback()` means inside a test.** Several services catch a unique-constraint
`IntegrityError` and call `session.rollback()` to recover and re-read the winning row (e.g.
`ServerConfigService.get_or_create`, `ChannelInboundService._upsert_binding`,
`GitSourceService._clear_poisoned_transaction` / `_cleanup_orphan_bundle`). Under this fixture,
that rollback unwinds to the current SAVEPOINT — established by step 2 — not to the outer
transaction, so data committed earlier in the same test survives. This only holds because of
`join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` in step 2: without it, that same `session.rollback()`
unwinds past the SAVEPOINT and expires/detaches objects committed earlier in the test, and the
next `session.get()` on them raises `ObjectDeletedError` even though their rows are still present
in the real transaction. A test that exercises an `IntegrityError`-recovery race
(`tests/api/server_channels/server_channels_security_invariants_test.py::
test_lost_race_ingest_branch_declines_the_loser` is the one that found this) is exactly the case
that depends on this mode being set correctly.

## Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

The API-only rule (Rule 1 below) applies to **`tests/api/` only**. `tests/unit/` is the home for
pure unit tests, and the rules there are different:

- **Allowed here**: importing from `app.services`, `app.core`, adapters, and env-template modules
  directly, and calling functions/classes in isolation. There is **no `client` and no `db`** — the
  unit conftest (`tests/unit/conftest.py`) overrides `setup_db` to a no-op, so no Postgres connection
  is opened.
- **What belongs in `tests/unit/`**: pure logic with no I/O — event transformers, parsers, decision
  tables, similarity/scoring functions, URL/path helpers, private `_helper` functions, egress-guard
  predicates, MagicMock-driven defensive-branch tests, and anything that asserts module-level
  constants. If a test only needs a function and some plain Python inputs, it goes here.
- **What does NOT belong here**: anything that needs the database, a real HTTP round-trip, the full
  app lifespan, or background-task draining. Those are integration tests and live in `tests/api/`.
  Litmus test: **if a "unit" test secretly needs `db` or `client`, it is not a pure unit test** —
  move it back to `tests/api/` (or split it). New unit files must run green under
  `tests/unit/conftest.py` with no DB engine.

### Cross-reference convention

When a private helper is unit-tested in `tests/unit/` but its API-observable behavior is covered by a
scenario in `tests/api/`, leave a one-line pointer in **both** directions so the pair stays
discoverable:

- In the api test file (module docstring or a comment near the related scenario):
  `# Unit tests for parse_commands_file live in tests/unit/test_cli_commands_service.py`
- In the unit test file: a docstring note that the end-to-end / API-observable path is covered in the
  corresponding `tests/api/<domain>/..._test.py`.

See `tests/api/agents/commands/agents_cli_commands_test.py` (module docstring "Notes") for the established
pattern.

```bash
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q
```

## Architecture Tests (`tests/architecture/`)

Contract / drift tests that assert structural invariants about the **application source tree** rather
than runtime behavior. They scan `backend/app/` and fail when the codebase drifts away from an
assumption the test suite relies on. Examples:

- `patch_target_drift_test.py` — every `app` module that imports `create_session` /
  `create_task_with_error_logging` must appear in the corresponding patch-target list in
  `tests/utils/fixtures.py` (or an explicit, commented allowlist). Otherwise a service silently opens
  sessions on the real engine during tests.
- `channel_ingestion_callers_test.py` — guards the set of modules participating in channel ingestion.

These tests import and inspect `app` modules directly; the API-only rule does not apply to them.

## Writing New Tests

### File Placement

Place test files under `tests/api/<domain>/test_<domain>.py`, mirroring the route structure in `app/api/routes/`. Create an `__init__.py` in each new directory.

A domain that grows past ~20 files is split into **topic group** subpackages one level deeper (`tests/api/<domain>/<group>/`). Group subdirs inherit the domain's `conftest.py` automatically, so they need only an `__init__.py`. `tests/api/agents/` is the one domain split this way today — its `README.md` carries the group map and the placement rule. When writing into a split domain, put the file in the matching group, never at the domain root.

Some domains have their own `README.md` with domain-specific testing patterns (e.g., stubs, extra fixtures, relaxed rules). **Always check for a `README.md` in the target directory before writing tests** — for example, `tests/api/agents/README.md` documents the session mocking and environment stubs required for agent tests.

### Fixtures

Every test function receives fixtures via pytest dependency injection. The key fixtures defined in `conftest.py`:

| Fixture | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `client` | function | `TestClient` with the test DB session injected |
| `superuser_token_headers` | function | `{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}` for the superuser |
| `normal_user_token_headers` | function | Auth headers for `test@example.com` (created if needed) |

Use `client` in every test. Use the auth header fixtures when the endpoint requires authentication.

### Test Structure: Scenario-Based Tests

Prefer **scenario-based tests** that walk through a user story end-to-end rather than writing many small atomic tests for individual operations. A single test function should set up state, perform a sequence of related actions, and verify the outcome at each step.

**Why scenarios over atomic tests:**
- They catch integration issues between steps (e.g., create → list → update → verify update appears in list)
- They mirror real user workflows, so failures point to actual broken behavior
- They reduce test setup duplication — each phase builds on the previous one
- Fewer tests to maintain while covering more surface area

**How to structure a scenario test:**
- Use comment headers (`# ── Phase N: ...`) to separate logical steps
- Assert at each phase, not just at the end — this makes failures easy to locate
- The docstring should outline the full story as a numbered list

```python
def test_widget_full_lifecycle(
    client: TestClient, superuser_token_headers: dict[str, str]
) -> None:
    """
    Full CRUD lifecycle:
      1. Create widget
      2. List widgets → verify it appears
      3. Update widget
      4. Verify update persisted
      5. Delete widget
      6. Verify it's gone
    """
    # ── Phase 1: Create ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    created = create_widget(client, superuser_token_headers, name="My Widget")
    widget_id = created["id"]

    # ── Phase 2: List → widget is present ─────────────────────────────
    widgets = list_widgets(client, superuser_token_headers)
    assert any(w["id"] == widget_id for w in widgets)

    # ── Phase 3: Update ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    updated = update_widget(client, superuser_token_headers, widget_id, name="Renamed")
    assert updated["name"] == "Renamed"

    # ── Phase 4: Verify update persisted ──────────────────────────────
    fetched = get_widget(client, superuser_token_headers, widget_id)
    assert fetched["name"] == "Renamed"

    # ── Phase 5: Delete ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    delete_widget(client, superuser_token_headers, widget_id)

    # ── Phase 6: Verify gone ──────────────────────────────────────────
    r = client.get(f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/widgets/{widget_id}",
                   headers=superuser_token_headers)
    assert r.status_code == 404
```

**Fold error and auth checks into the scenario as phases, not separate tests.**

404 (not-found), ownership guards, and auth rejections are not standalone stories — they are
observable properties of the resource you just created. Test them inline, right after the
resource exists, so no extra setup is needed:

```python
    # ── Phase N: Auth and ownership guards ────────────────────────────
    # Unauthenticated request is rejected
    assert client.get(f"{_BASE}/").status_code in (401, 403)

    # Other user cannot read or mutate the resource
    other = create_random_user(client)
    other_h = user_authentication_headers(client=client, email=other["email"], password=other["_password"])
    assert client.get(f"{_BASE}/{resource_id}", headers=other_h).status_code == 404
    assert client.put(f"{_BASE}/{resource_id}", headers=other_h, json={}).status_code == 404
    assert client.delete(f"{_BASE}/{resource_id}", headers=other_h).status_code == 404

    # Non-existent ID returns 404
    ghost = str(uuid.uuid4())
    assert client.get(f"{_BASE}/{ghost}", headers=headers).status_code == 404
```

**A standalone test is only justified when:**
- The error case requires completely different setup (e.g., a separate user role or a
  precondition that cannot exist in the main flow)
- Testing a validation rule that fires before any resource is created (e.g., a missing
  required field on POST)

### Creating Test Data

Always create test data through API endpoints, never through direct DB calls. Reusable helpers live in `tests/utils/`:

```python
from tests.utils.user import create_random_user, user_authentication_headers
from tests.utils.ai_credential import create_random_ai_credential
from tests.utils.agent import create_agent_via_api
```

### Test Utility Helpers

Every repeated API call pattern should be extracted into a helper in `tests/utils/<domain>.py`. Helpers follow these conventions:

1. **Encapsulate HTTP call + status assertion**, return parsed JSON:
   ```python
   def set_ai_credential_default(client, token_headers, credential_id) -> dict:
       r = client.post(f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/ai-credentials/{credential_id}/set-default",
                       headers=token_headers)
       assert r.status_code == 200
       return r.json()
   ```

2. **Compose common sequences** via parameters instead of separate calls:
   ```python
   # Instead of create + set_default in every test:
   cred = create_random_ai_credential(client, headers, set_default=True)
   ```

3. **Keep inline calls only when testing the endpoint itself** (checking specific status codes, error responses, or response structure):
   ```python
   # Testing 403 — keep inline, don't use the helper
   r = client.post(f".../{cred['id']}/set-default", headers=other_user_headers)
   assert r.status_code == 403
   ```

4. **Naming**: `create_*` for POST, `get_*` for GET, `update_*` for PATCH, `delete_*` for DELETE, with the domain as prefix (e.g., `create_random_ai_credential`, `get_ai_credentials_profile`).

### Verifying Side-Effects

Instead of querying the database directly, verify through the API:

```python
# BAD - direct DB access
user = crud.get_user_by_email(session=db, email=email)
assert verify_password(new_password, user.hashed_password)

# GOOD - verify via API
r = client.post(f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/login/access-token",
                data={"username": email, "password": new_password})
assert r.status_code == 200
```

### Mocking External Services

Use `unittest.mock.patch` for external services (email, OAuth, etc.):

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_password_recovery(client: TestClient) -> None:
    with (
        # emails_enabled is SMTP_HOST and EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL; SMTP_HOST is
        # empty in the test container, so without this the send short-circuits
        # before it ever reaches the patched symbol.
        patch.object(settings, "SMTP_HOST", "smtp.example.com"),
        patch.object(settings, "EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL", "info@example.com"),
        # Patched at the BINDING SITE, not at app.utils — see below.
        patch("app.services.users.user_service.send_email") as send_email,
    ):
        r = client.post(f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/password-recovery/{email}")
        assert r.status_code == 200
        # Prove the patch intercepted. The response is deliberately generic
        # whether or not mail went out, so it proves nothing on its own.
        send_email.assert_called_once()
```

**Patch `send_email` at the binding site, and assert the mock was called.**
The container runs mailcatcher, so a real SMTP connection is absorbed silently
and a live 500 in the mail path passes as green. And every consumer does
`from app.utils import send_email` at import time, which binds the name in
*that* module — so `patch("app.utils.send_email")` rebinds a symbol nobody
looks at and the test passes while proving nothing. The current binding sites:

| Module | Patch target |
|---|---|
| `app/api/routes/users.py` | `app.api.routes.users.send_email` |
| `app/api/routes/utils.py` | `app.api.routes.utils.send_email` |
| `app/services/users/email_confirmation_service.py` | `app.services.users.email_confirmation_service.send_email` |
| `app/services/users/user_service.py` | `app.services.users.user_service.send_email` |
| `app/services/users/invitation_service.py` | `app.services.users.invitation_service.send_email` |
| `app/services/notifications/notification_service.py` | `app.services.notifications.notification_service.send_email` |

A route that sends two different mails through two different bindings needs
both patched — `tests/api/auth/test_new_account_email.py` is the worked
example. Ready-made context managers for the two most-used bindings live in
`tests/utils/invitation.py` (`invitation_email_patched`,
`recovery_email_patched`); both also turn `emails_enabled` on.

A call-count assertion alone still passes when the template renders an empty
body, so where the *content* matters, assert on `html_content` too.

## Rules

1. **No imports from `app.crud`, `app.services`, or `app.core.security`** in `tests/api/` files. The only allowed app imports are `app.core.config.settings` (for API URL prefix and config values) and `app.utils` (for token generation in password-reset tests). This rule applies to `tests/api/` only — `tests/unit/` and `tests/architecture/` may import app internals (see "Unit Tests" and "Architecture Tests" above).
2. **All test data created via API endpoints.** Use the helpers in `tests/utils/`.
3. **All verification via API responses.** Check status codes and JSON bodies. Verify side-effects by calling other endpoints (e.g., log in to verify a password change).
4. **Each test is independent.** Transaction rollback ensures no state leaks. Do not rely on test execution order.
5. **Use random data.** Use `random_email()` and `random_lower_string()` for test data to avoid collisions.
6. **Mock external calls.** Patch SMTP, OAuth, and any external HTTP calls.
7. **Extract repeated API calls into `tests/utils/` helpers.** If the same endpoint call appears in multiple tests as setup (not as the thing being tested), wrap it in a utility function. Compose common multi-step sequences via parameters (e.g., `set_default=True`).
8. **Snapshot with `cp` before a mutation check; restore from the snapshot and verify with `diff`. Never revert a mutation check with `git`.** Concretely: `cp app/services/foo.py app/services/foo.py.bak` before mutating, `cp app/services/foo.py.bak app/services/foo.py` to restore, then `diff app/services/foo.py app/services/foo.py.bak` to confirm the restore is byte-identical before deleting the backup. `git checkout -- <file>` fails two different ways in this tree, and both report success:
   - On a tracked file, the working tree here has been dirty since before the current feature, so it reverts *past* your mutation to the last commit — discarding other people's uncommitted work. The reverted state is a coherent older version, so the suite goes green on it. You are told everything is fine while work is gone.
   - On a path that includes untracked files — a directory or glob, which most in-flight feature directories mix — it exits 0 and silently skips them: no error, no mention. Naming a bare untracked file errors loudly instead (exit 1), so the dangerous form is the *scoped* one that partially succeeds. You are told the restore succeeded while your mutation is still in place, and the next run measures the mutated tree.

   Partial success is worse than either total failure or total success: the tree ends in a state nobody intended, and the exit code describes neither half. So the rule is not "avoid a `git checkout --` footgun" — it is `cp` first, restore from the copy, `diff` to confirm byte-identity. Verify the effect, never the exit code. If a mutation-check revert ever looks off (an unexpectedly empty `git diff HEAD`, a file shorter than you left it), say so immediately rather than quietly restoring and moving on — a near-miss that gets silently corrected teaches nobody.

## Testing Session-Driven Flows (Tasks, Agents, Streaming)

Tests that exercise agent streaming (message send → agent response → session completion) require understanding the async architecture. The key mental model:

### Execution Timing

`execute_task()` and `send_message()` **return immediately** — they only schedule `process_pending_messages` as a background task. The actual streaming (agent-env connector call, event emission, session status updates) happens inside `drain_tasks()`. This means:

```python
# WRONG — stub not active during streaming
with patch("app.services.message_service.agent_env_connector", stub):
    exec_result = execute_task(client, headers, task_id)
# drain_tasks() runs outside the patch — stub not used!
drain_tasks()

# CORRECT — stub active during drain
with patch("app.services.message_service.agent_env_connector", stub):
    exec_result = execute_task(client, headers, task_id)
    drain_tasks()  # streaming happens here, inside the patch
```

If you need the session_id before building the stub (e.g., to include `source_session_id` in a tool call), call `execute_task` first with a placeholder stub, then build the real stub and drain:

```python
with patch("...", StubAgentEnvConnector(response_text="placeholder")):
    exec_result = execute_task(client, headers, task_id)

session_id = str(exec_result["session_id"])
real_stub = ScriptedAgentEnvConnector(client=client, auth_headers=headers, steps=[...])
with patch("...", real_stub):
    drain_tasks()
```

### Session Completion Drives Task Status

After `drain_tasks()`, session completion event handlers fire and automatically sync task status via `sync_task_status_from_sessions`. **Do not manually call `agent_update_status("completed")`** — verify the automatic transition instead:

```python
with patch("...", stub):
    execute_task(client, headers, task_id)
    drain_tasks()

# Task auto-completed by session lifecycle events
task = get_task(client, headers, task_id)
assert task["status"] == "completed"  # session-driven, not manual
```

A task with subtasks stays `in_progress` until ALL subtasks complete. When a subtask completes, feedback delivery sends a message to the parent's session, which re-streams and re-syncs the parent.

### Cascading Drain Rounds

`drain_tasks()` runs up to 10 rounds. Each round may spawn new tasks:

1. `process_pending_messages` → stream → "done" → emits STREAM_COMPLETED
2. Event handlers fire (SessionService, InputTaskService, ActivityService)
3. `deliver_feedback_to_source` may schedule another `process_pending_messages`
4. The feedback stream completes → another round of handlers

This is correct behavior. Stubs must handle being called multiple times — `ScriptedAgentEnvConnector` runs scripted steps only on the first call and falls back to a simple response on subsequent calls.

### Stub Selection

| Scenario | Stub | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Simple agent response | `StubAgentEnvConnector(response_text="...")` | Just needs to yield events and complete |
| Agent calls MCP tools mid-stream | `ScriptedAgentEnvConnector(client, headers, steps=[...])` | Makes real HTTP calls to backend during stream |
| Error response | `StubAgentEnvConnector(events=[{"type": "error", ...}])` | Custom event sequence |

### ScriptedAgentEnvConnector — Simulating MCP Tool Calls

In production, the agent SDK calls MCP tools (HTTP requests back to the backend) **during** the SSE stream, before the "done" event. `ScriptedAgentEnvConnector` replicates this:

```python
stub = ScriptedAgentEnvConnector(
    client=client,
    auth_headers=headers,
    steps=[
        {"type": "assistant", "content": "I'll create a subtask."},
        {
            "type": "tool_call",
            "endpoint": f"/api/v1/agent/tasks/{task_id}/subtask",
            "method": "POST",
            "json": {"title": "Do X", "assigned_to": "Worker Agent"},
            "tool_name": "mcp__agent_task__create_subtask",
        },
        {"type": "assistant", "content": "Subtask created."},
    ],
)
```

The `tool_call` step makes a real HTTP request to the TestClient. Results are tracked in `stub.tool_results`. Only the first `stream_chat` call executes scripted steps; subsequent calls (from cascading feedback) use a simple fallback (`stub.fallback_call_count` tracks how many times).

### Source Code Invariants That Tests Depend On

Tests rely on these patterns in the application code. If you find code that violates them, **fix the source code rather than working around it in the test**:

1. **Event handlers must use `create_session()`** (not `DBSession(engine)`). Handlers using `DBSession(engine)` create sessions outside the test transaction — they can't see test data and silently return. Every handler in `session_service.py`, `activity_service.py`, and `input_task_service.py` should use `with create_session() as db:`.

2. **Status transitions must go through `update_task_status()`** for audit trail. If you find code setting `task.status = ...` directly, it bypasses `TaskStatusHistory` and system comments. Fix the source to use `update_task_status()`.

3. **New services importing `create_session` must be added to patch targets.** If a new service file imports `from app.core.db import create_session`, add `"app.services.new_service.create_session"` to `CREATE_SESSION_TARGETS_AGENT` in `tests/utils/fixtures.py`. Similarly for `create_task_with_error_logging` → `BACKGROUND_TASK_TARGETS_FULL`.

When a test needs a workaround (e.g., explicit status override, relaxed assertions), that's a signal to investigate whether the source code has a pattern violation.

## Code Style (for application code)

- **Datetime**: Use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` instead of deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`.
