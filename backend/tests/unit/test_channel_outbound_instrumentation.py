"""``ChannelOutboundService._deliver`` must not destroy the failure it records.

The twin of ``test_channel_reply_instrumentation.py``, and the worse half of
the pair: that file covers the *notice* path, this one covers the
**agent-reply** path, which carries the traffic. Same §11a Rule 2 defect
shape — "the test for a new instrumentation point is not 'is the recorder
guarded' but 'can anything in the caller's argument list raise'", proved by
firing a poison object rather than by reading the code (see
``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §11a).

``_deliver``'s ``except`` held **five** unguarded expressions where ``_reply``
held two, and one more consequence: besides the debug-buffer record, the
handler also calls ``_record_error``. A raise anywhere in the handler
therefore lost the delivery diagnosis in *both* places an operator looks — the
debug panel and the binding row — and handed the caller an unrelated database
error in its place.

What each test below pins, and why that expression was exposed:

* ``channel.id`` — read inside the ``except`` (twice) and, worse, in the
  **success** branch where there was no ``try`` at all. Every path into
  ``_deliver`` arrives after a ``db.commit()`` that expired the instance, so
  the read is a lazy reload; reloading a concurrently deleted row raises
  ``ObjectDeletedError``. ``_Vanished`` stands in for that (a unit test has no
  session to expire).
* ``binding.thread_key`` — the same reload hazard on the binding.
* ``f"Delivery failed: {exc}"`` and ``str(exc)`` — an exception with a raising
  ``__str__``, one of the five shapes Rule 2 names.
* ``logger.warning(..., exc)`` — lazy interpolation. ``logging`` swallows its
  own formatting errors in production while pytest's ``LogCaptureHandler``
  re-raises them, so a raw ``exc`` here is a guard whose correctness depends
  on which handler is installed. Pre-formatted through ``_log_detail``.
* ``_record_error`` itself — it reads ``binding.status`` and rolls back a
  session, either of which can raise from inside the handler. Covered by its
  own tests at the bottom of this file, including the one thing the fix
  deliberately does **not** solve.

Pure logic with fakes: no DB, no ``TestClient``, no HTTP.

A note on how failures are pinned below: this file used to lean on
``caplog.text`` substring checks throughout. Those are **vacuous** once the
session-scoped ``setup_db`` fixture has run Alembic — ``alembic.config.Config``
calls ``logging.config.fileConfig`` with its default
``disable_existing_loggers=True``, which leaves every application logger
(this module's included) permanently ``disabled`` for the rest of the test
session (see ``tests/README.md``, "caplog assertions are vacuous for the rest
of the session"). Every assertion below is instead made either directly on
the object flowing through the code (``_spy_log_detail``,
``_spy_binding_thread_key``) or, for the one property that genuinely IS a log
line, on a real ``LogRecord`` captured off an explicitly un-disabled logger
(``_unswallowed_channel_debug_key_warnings``) — the same discrimination
``test_channel_reply_instrumentation.py`` uses, and for the same reason.

# ── ``set_status`` must be TOTAL, not merely ``ChannelError``-safe ────────────
#
# The band comment above the status-notice verbs states the contract out loud:
# "Every one of them is best-effort and none of them raise". The only
# unguarded expression in ``set_status`` is its adapter lookup, and
# ``channel.channel_type`` inside it is the same expired-instance lazy reload
# every helper in this file exists for — so a guard that named only
# ``ChannelError`` did not deliver that contract.
#
# Three callers depend on it, and none of them can absorb a raise:
#
#  * ``_route_new_thread``'s Pass 1 hand-off — a raise between the adopt and
#    ``bound = binding`` leaves the row owning the notice while the failure
#    handler settles a stale local, so the flush loop patches "ready" over the
#    sender's last word.
#  * ``_install_and_park`` — the same window, across its ``return``.
#  * The outer failure handler itself, which settles THROUGH these verbs. The
#    exception it is handling is often a DB error, so the session is poisoned
#    and the reload raises ``PendingRollbackError`` out of the handler — the
#    notice is then stranded on "Setting up…" with no code path left to touch
#    it.
