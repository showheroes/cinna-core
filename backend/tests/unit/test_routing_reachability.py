"""`RoutingReachabilityService` — the properties that need no database.

The verdict *sentences* are covered end-to-end, one test per branch, in
`tests/api/routing/routing_reachability_verdict_test.py` — they are statements
about what routing actually did and are proved against real routing decisions.
What is left here is the part of this service that is pure: totality, the
near-miss ranking, and the candidate roll-up.

Four properties, each one there because its failure mode is silent:

1. **`diagnose` never raises.** Its caller is `RoutingTraceService.get`, which
   serves the whole trace. A diagnosis that propagated would take the trace
   detail down with it — §11a Rule 2's shape, on a read path: the debugging aid
   breaking the thing it observes.
2. **The Jaccard helpers are *called*, not copied.** Plan §3 says reuse
   `app.services.routing.text_similarity`'s `jaccard_similarity` /
   `tokens_for_similarity` verbatim. A copy would pass every behavioural test in
   this file and then drift the first time either side was tuned, so the test
   asserts the call itself rather than the numbers it produces.
3. **A candidate seen in two stages is one candidate.** "This user has N
   effective routes" is the verdict's headline number; counted twice it is a
   wrong number stated with confidence.
4. **The verdict is split by `origin`**, and some of the split cannot be driven
   through a real decision at all — which is why the last section is here rather
   than in the API file next to the rest of the sentences.

   Two shapes are undrivable, for two different reasons:

   - Skip reasons **no surface produces any more**: `identity_route` (deleted
     from the channel path by the scope split) and `foreign_owner` (kept as a
     defence-in-depth postcondition that is unreachable by construction, since
     every channel candidate came out of `WHERE owner_id = sender`). Rows
     written before the split still carry them and the admin UI still renders
     them, so their sentences still have to be right.
   - Skip reasons a channel can produce only through a **race** —
     `agent_missing` needs the winning agent deleted between the candidate scan
     and the lookup — plus `route_inactive`, whose producer moved off the
     channel path entirely but whose historical rows did not.

   A third shape used to live here: an `origin="app_mcp"` decision **with a
   candidate list**, needed because plan §9's "3 effective routes" headline was
   App MCP's own count noun and nothing opens an App MCP capture to drive it
   through the API file. Phase 5 of `docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/`
   deleted the `AppAgentRoute` family that noun described — App MCP now builds
   its ballot from the same two candidate providers a channel does, so there is
   no route left for any verdict to count, and both origins say "N eligible
   candidates". The noun is gone, not merely hard to drive, so there is nothing
   left here to assert; `test_the_counted_noun_follows_the_origin` and
   `test_an_unknown_origin_gets_the_app_mcp_wording`, which pinned the old
   per-origin wording, were deleted with it.

   The second of those two named a rule that no longer holds either way. An
   unknown origin used to be given the App MCP wording deliberately, on the
   argument that it was the narrower of two arms. Phase 6 of the channels &
   identity unification replaced the boolean with a remedy **profile** per
   origin and an explicit generic default, so an unmapped origin now names no
   surface at all — pinned in
   `tests/api/routing/routing_reachability_verdict_test.py`'s remedy-profile
   section, where a seeded origin can be handed to the API.

    `test_verdict_for_an_identity_owner_who_shared_nothing_reachable`. The base
    entry cannot be reached the same way: it needs an `origin="app_mcp"` trace

    `"MCP Server card" not in verdict`, because the channel override must not
    send a channel reader to an App MCP control. This one is the entry that
    *does* speak in App MCP's voice, so the same phrase must be present — and
