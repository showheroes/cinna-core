"""Local Agent Kit tool (`docs/local_agent_kit/tools/kit.py`) — pure unit tests.

The kit is shipped content, not backend code: `kit.py` is stdlib-only Python that
runs on the *user's* machine next to a scaffolded agent. These tests guarantee the
shipped scaffold still validates against the shipped tool, that an export never
carries secrets to the cloud, and that the tar extraction used by `kit.py refresh`
refuses to escape its destination.

Every CLI command is invoked as a subprocess with `sys.executable`, so the
stdlib-only constraint is genuinely exercised (a third-party import would fail the
run rather than pass silently through the test's own environment).

Kit location: `docs/` is not mounted into the backend container, so inside Docker
this module reads the kit from the synced snapshot at
`app/env-templates/platform-knowledge-env/.../knowledge/local-kit/`, which
`make sync-platform-knowledge` writes. Set `LOCAL_AGENT_KIT_DIR` to point it at
any other copy — `_find_kit_dir` reads it, so naming that variable IS positive
evidence about which bytes a run exercised (unlike the backend service path,
which never reads it). A run against a stale snapshot reports green about a kit
nobody edited, so say which copy was tested.

Two capabilities this module needs are not present in every environment, and
both are detected by PROVOKING them rather than inferred from `os.geteuid()` or
a platform name — an absence of complaints is evidence only once you have shown
the tool would have complained:

* **file permissions.** The backend container runs as root, where `chmod 000`
  does not block a read, so every permission case here would pass while testing
  nothing. `require_enforced_permissions` makes an unreadable file and tries to
  read it, and skips when the read succeeds.
* **loopback sockets.** The `chat` scenarios bind `127.0.0.1:0`.

# EXEMPT "platform-rendered" tokens from the leftover-scaffold-token scan on the
# pre-Phase-6 premise that UPPER_SNAKE meant platform. Phase 6 made the scaffold
# tokens UPPER_SNAKE too, so an unsubstituted `{{NAME}}` in a scaffolded agent
# matched the exemption and PASSED the check written precisely to catch it. It did

# Shape cannot separate the two classes, and neither can membership. `kit.py`'s
# `SCAFFOLD_TOKENS` comment is the upstream authority and says so in as many
# words: "A list cannot classify a member it contains, and this one contains
# `KIT_VERSION`. What settles the question is PROVENANCE." `KIT_VERSION` is in
# both sets on purpose — the platform fills it when it renders a kit for
# download, and `new` fills it when the kit was never rendered.
#
# So this scan asks the provenance question instead of a shape question, and asks
# it of `kit.py` rather than restating its answer:
#
#   * the six tokens `new` alone fills must never survive `kit.py new`;
#   * `KIT_VERSION`'s fate depends on where THIS kit came from — `kit_version()`
#     returns None for an unrendered checkout, and `substitute_tokens` documents
#     that a None value is left unsubstituted so "a kit that never learned its own
#     version ships a visible KIT_VERSION token rather than a plausible wrong one";
#   * any other token found must be one the kit itself still carries unrendered,
#     i.e. the platform's to fill — never something `new` invented.

    into the source and asserted the exported copy came out nulled. `cmd_export`

    deliberately removed; they find the removal comment in `cmd_export` and have
    two artefacts that disagree, with no way to tell which is current.

# `kit.py chat` — token secrecy and token egress (Phase 12, BLOCKING)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# READ THIS BEFORE SIMPLIFYING ANYTHING BELOW.
#
# The two egress tests are written as DIFFERENTIALS — the guard removed from a
# scratch copy of `kit.py`, then the guard in place — and not as happy-path
# assertions, because **a test that only asserts the current code path passes
# proves nothing about the default it exists to defend against.**
#
# The defaults in question are library defaults, not bugs in this file:
#
# * `urllib`'s `HTTPRedirectHandler.redirect_request` copies the request headers
#   onto the redirected request, dropping only `Content-Length` and
#   `Content-Type` — so `Authorization: Bearer <agent_token>` survives a
#   cross-origin 302, and for a POST 301/302/303 are auto-followed as a GET;
# * a default opener honours `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `all_proxy` from the
#   environment, and `no_proxy` does not reliably cover loopback.
#
# A test that drives `chat` at a well-behaved stub and checks the answer passes
# **identically** with `_NoChatRedirect()` and `ProxyHandler({})` deleted from
# `_chat_opener`. That deletion is exactly the edit these tests exist to stop, so
# a run that cannot distinguish the two states is not evidence about either.
#
# The leak's symptom is the reason this outranks the rest of the file: with the
# redirect guard removed, `chat` does not fail — it exits 0 and prints the
# foreign host's answer. A silent, successful-looking run that has posted a live
# bearer token to somebody else's server.
#
# The shape of each differential, twice per guard against ONE stub topology:
#   guard removed ⇒ the recording foreign host / proxy RECEIVES the bearer token;
#   guard present ⇒ exit non-zero, and the recording host receives no request at
#                   all — "nothing was sent", asserted on the recorder, not on
#                   the absence of the token from our own output.
#
# `_kit_copy_without_guard` asserts the anchor was found and that the text
# actually changed before the copy is used: a reverted-copy differential that
# measured the unmodified file would report a comfortable zero-leaks result.


# A value that exists nowhere else in this repo, so finding it in a recorder or
# in captured output is unambiguous.

# Permission handling (the `PermissionError` fix round, §0 Bucket 21)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Three conditions, three lists, three messages, ONE policy — refuse, and
# `--force` waives none:
#
#   1. a FILE whose bytes will not read      → `hash_export_files`' list
#   2. a DIRECTORY the export walk cannot scan → `collect_export_tree`'s list
#   3. a DIRECTORY `validate` reads that the export never touches → this is the
#      one that did not exist, and (3) cannot be folded into (2) because (2)'s
#      walk never descends into an EXCLUDED directory — which is precisely what
#      makes an unreadable `credentials/` cost the export nothing.
#
# Every case below is guarded by `require_enforced_permissions`, which PROVOKES a
# `PermissionError` rather than inferring one from `os.geteuid()`. The backend
# container runs as root, where `chmod 000` does not block a read: without the
# guard each of these would pass while testing nothing — the exclude-list
# analogue of the stale-mirror trap, and the exact instrument failure §0 Bucket
# 21f records (a probe that `chmod 000`'d a file that does not travel and
# reported an empty unreadable list: a passing test of nothing).
