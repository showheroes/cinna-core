"""``RoutingTrace`` recorder semantics.

Pure in-process logic with no I/O — no database, no settings, no HTTP — so it
is unit-tested rather than driven through the API (see the module docstring
on ``app.services.routing.routing_trace`` for why that isolation matters: a
later phase adds a DB-backed sibling module, and this one must stay clean).

This file pins the three properties §5 of the Auto Routing Tuning plan
(``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md``) demands of the recorder:

  1. Every ``record_*`` entry point no-ops when there is no active capture —
     an un-instrumented caller pays one ``ContextVar`` read and nothing else.
  2. Capture survives ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``. Channel routing runs its
     LLM call in a worker thread; anyio propagates a *copy* of the calling
     context into that thread, and because the ``ContextVar`` holds a
     **mutable** ``RoutingTrace``, mutations made inside the worker must be
     visible through the caller's own reference once the awaited call
     returns. This is the single highest-value test in this file: per §12,
     silent loss of capture across the thread hop is the worst failure mode
     for a debugging aid, and ``tests/api/server_channels/conftest.py``'s
     ``patch_anyio_to_thread`` fixture runs that same offload **inline** for
     every API-level test — so nothing under ``tests/api/`` ever exercises
     the real cross-thread path. This unit test is the only place it is
     exercised, and it deliberately does NOT import or rely on that fixture.
  3. The recorder never raises into its caller, even fed garbage. §5 draws a
     sharp line here: the guard protects the *recording*, not the caller's
     own argument-expression evaluation (an ``AttributeError`` raised while
     *building* an argument happens before the call and is not this module's
     problem). What every guarded entry point must do is swallow an error
     raised while *it itself* reads attributes off (or stringifies) the
     value it was already handed.

A genuine gap in property 3 turned up while writing this file — the three
``record_prompt`` / ``record_raw_response`` / ``record_parse_outcome``
helpers called ``clamp()`` unguarded. It has since been fixed; see
``test_record_prompt_raw_response_and_parse_outcome_guard_bad_str`` below,
which now pins the guard.
