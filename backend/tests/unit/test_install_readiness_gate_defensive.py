"""
Unit tests for the defensive (DB-corruption) branches of
``InstallReadinessGate.check``.

These branches are unreachable through the API in production because the FK
constraints either cascade-delete the dangling link (Credential delete →
AgentCredentialLink CASCADE) or NULL the bundle reference (AICredential delete →
SET NULL). They are exercised here with a fully mocked DB session — no real
database, no TestClient. The API-observable readiness verdicts (ready /
needs_setup / publisher_broken) are covered against ``GET /agents/{id}/setup-status``
in ``tests/api/agents/bundles_install/agents_bundles_install_readiness_test.py``.
