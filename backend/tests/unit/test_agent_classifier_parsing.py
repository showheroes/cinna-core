"""
`AgentClassifier`'s parse of the Phase 5 prompt contract.

The contract grew three advisory fields — `confidence`, `reason`, `runner_up` —
and the property that matters most about them is **negative**: a model that
ignores all three must still route. Local and small models routinely drop
fields added to a JSON schema, and this project's own default cascade ends at a
self-hosted `granite4`, so a strict parse would have turned a tuning feature
into a routing outage for exactly the deployments least able to diagnose it.

Everything here is a regression guard (it asserts behaviour the parse could
plausibly break), not a precondition assertion — each one is expected to survive
a mutation check.

No DB, no Docker, no LLM calls.
