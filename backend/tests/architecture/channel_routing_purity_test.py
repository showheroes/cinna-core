"""Architecture drift test — ``decide()`` must stay unable to have side effects.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Phase 3 of Auto Routing Tuning (``docs/plans/auto_routing_tuning_plan.md`` §6)
turns ``POST /admin/routing/simulate`` into a route that runs the real router
over a real user's real routing state and then does nothing with the answer: no
thread binding, no session, no bundle install, no outbound reply.

The plan is explicit that this must hold **by construction, not by a flag
threaded through 200 lines**. So there is no ``simulate=True`` parameter
anywhere: the decision was split out into
``app/services/server_channels/channel_routing_service.py``, and the effects
stayed in ``channel_inbound_service.py``. Simulate calls ``decide`` and stops.

That is only a structural guarantee for as long as the routing module cannot
*reach* an effect. It cannot today because the names are not in its namespace —
binding it would require adding an import, which is visible in a diff. This
test is the trip-wire that makes "visible in a diff" into "fails in CI",
because a plausible-looking future change ("while we're here, let's record the
binding in decide so the trace can link to it") would restore the exact hazard
the split removed, and every no-side-effects test in
``tests/api/routing/routing_simulate_no_side_effects_test.py`` would then be
asserting something that had quietly stopped being true of the design and was
only still true of today's branches.

WHAT IT ENFORCES
----------------
The four numbered structural facts in the module docstring of
``channel_routing_service.py``, one parameterized case each, numbered to match
that docstring so a failure names the fact a reader can go and read:

1. **No caller session crosses the boundary.** The module's entry point
   (``ChannelRoutingService.decide``) takes no database session parameter. A
   caller session crossing that boundary is what would let the decision commit,
   roll back, or add to somebody else's transaction; keeping ids and text on the
   signature is the same rule ``run_in_thread`` already enforces one level down.
2. **The sessions it opens are read-only in practice.** The module calls no
   session-writing method (``add``/``commit``/``delete``/...), so a direct write
   cannot slip past the name blocklist in #3, which is a list of nouns and blind
   to verbs.
3. **Nothing effectful is imported here.** The module references none of the
   effect-performing names — not as imports, not as bare names, not as
   attributes.
4. **It returns plain data.** ``decide`` returns a ``RoutingDecisionResult``,
   and every field on it is plain data — an id, a recorder, or a flag. Never an
   ORM instance, whose session is closed by the time the caller sees it. Since
   Phase 2 of the channels/identity refactor, the same checker also walks
   ``ResolvedChannelPolicy`` (``channel_policy_service.py``) — the value
   ``decide`` takes IN across the identical thread boundary — because "plain
   data" is a property of the boundary in both directions, not just the
   outbound one.

OVER WHICH MODULES, AND WHY TWO
-------------------------------
Every fact above runs over **two** modules, listed in ``_GUARDED`` below:
``channel_routing_service.py`` and ``app/services/identity/
identity_routing_service.py``.

The second one arrived with Phase 3 of the channels & identity unification,
which made ``decide`` call ``IdentityRoutingService.route_within_identity``
(identity Stage 2) from inside itself when the classifier picks a person. From
that moment a caller session accepted there, a write made there, an effect
imported there, or an ORM row returned from there is a violation of the *same*
four facts, one call deeper, underneath a route documented as having no side
effects. That module's own docstring had stated the four and said in as many
words that they were "held by review here, not by a test", naming this exact
change as one of the two ways to close it. This is that closure.

The two are **not identical in shape**, and the differences are data on the
``_GuardedModule`` record rather than branches inside the checkers: the entry
point is ``decide`` in one and ``route_within_identity`` in the other, the
plain-data result class is ``RoutingDecisionResult`` versus
``IdentityRoutingResult``, and only the routing module takes a second
plain-data value (``ResolvedChannelPolicy``) IN across the same boundary.
Fact 4's checker therefore reads its class names off the record and walks the
extra classes the record names, instead of hard-coding either.

HOW IT IS STRUCTURED, AND WHY THAT SHAPE
----------------------------------------
Each fact is a ``_StructuralFact`` record in ``_FACTS`` below — number, id,
description, and the callable that checks it — and a single test is
parameterized over ``_FACTS`` × ``_GUARDED``, one case per (fact, module) pair.
They are **not** collapsed into one shared assertion body: the four use
genuinely different mechanisms (a name/import blocklist, a call-verb blocklist,
a signature check, a return-annotation allowlist), and a common body would have
to be generic enough to describe none of them. What is shared is the parameter
list, the module parse, and the pytest id — not the reasoning. Each checker
keeps its own failure message, naming which guarantee broke and where the code
belongs instead.

**Two parametrize decorators, not a second copy of the checkers.** Master plan
§2.14 of the channels & identity unification settles that this file gets
*restructured* into parameterized sub-tests rather than grown ad hoc, and the
second module is the first test of that: a duplicated ``_check_*`` family
pointed at a different path would drift from this one within a phase, and the
count meta-check below would then be asserting the shape of a list nobody kept
in step. One family of checkers, two module records.

**``_FACTS`` is the list of facts**, and its length is asserted against the
count of numbered facts parsed out of **each** guarded module's docstring
(``test_fact_list_matches_the_service_module_docstring``, itself parameterized
over ``_GUARDED``). That test is the meta-check, not a fifth fact. It also
asserts the checkers are distinct: parameterization costs the property that a
missing checker was a missing test, because a record whose ``check=`` was copied
from its neighbour still collects, still passes, and still counts — so that is
checked rather than assumed.

Requiring *both* docstrings to state the same four is what keeps the second
module a peer rather than a passenger. It is why ``identity_routing_service``'s
list was renumbered in the change that added it here: it used to state three of
these four plus a note about the ambient trace recorder, which is an
implementation detail and not a structural fact, and a list that only mostly
matches is exactly the shape this file exists to refuse.

The count is asserted rather than merely asserted-in-prose because this file's
own history is the argument for it: it claimed four structural facts while
enforcing three, from the day both were written, and a claim about coverage is
the one claim a reader has no way to spot as false. The service docstring's
list is a flat, numbered, bold-titled markdown list, which parses in one regex
and fails loudly rather than silently if the shape ever changes — so the
stronger of the two options in the plan (§2.3 of
``docs/plans/channels_identity_unification/phase_0_land_scope_split.md``) was
available and is what is used. Adding a fifth fact over there now fails here
until a fifth checker lands in the same change, which is exactly the coupling
both docstrings say they want.

WHY AST AND NOT A GREP
----------------------
The module's own docstring names ``ChannelThreadBinding`` and
``ChannelOutboundService`` in prose, explaining why they are absent. A text
scan would match that prose and either fail permanently or have to be weakened
with exclusions until it stopped meaning anything. An AST walk over ``Name`` /
``Attribute`` / import nodes sees identifiers and not comments, so the
docstring can say the thing the test enforces without the two fighting.

The one place this file *does* read prose is the fact-count check, and it reads
it from the docstring deliberately: there the prose is the subject, not an
obstacle.

SEE ALSO
--------
``channel_routing_scope_test.py``, a sibling rather than an extension of this
file. It guards a different property — that channel routing does not import the
App MCP candidate set — over a module set that includes the candidate provider.
The "four facts, one case per module" pairing above is load-bearing, so a fifth
fact in here about something else would blunt exactly the invariant it holds.
Growing the *module* list is the axis this file is built to grow along; growing
the *fact* list is not.

It does deliberately NOT try to be a reachability analysis. ``decide`` calls
``ChannelCandidateProvider`` and ``CatalogService``, which are read-only today
but are not pinned as such by anything here; a transitive check would have to
model the whole service graph. This is the cheap structural half — the
behavioural half is the API-level no-side-effects suite, which is
mutation-checked.

    exact same hazard in the other direction: the worker thread's first
    attribute read on it would be a lazy reload against whatever session
    ``ChannelPolicyService.resolve`` used, already closed by the time
    ``decide`` runs. ``ResolvedChannelPolicy`` says so in its own docstring
    ("ids, bools, strings, and a frozenset. No ORM instances..."), and this is
    that claim executed too — the same technique this checker already uses
    for ``RoutingDecisionResult``, pointed at a second class in a second
    module.

    Folded into fact 4 rather than added as a fifth fact: "returns/carries
    only plain data" is one property applied to both directions of one
    boundary, not two properties, and this file's own docstring (the
    "HOW IT IS STRUCTURED" section) argues against growing ``_FACTS`` for
    something a stronger existing checker already covers -- see master plan
    §2.14.

    **The class names come off the** ``_GuardedModule`` **record, not from
    this function.** Identity Stage 2 returns ``IdentityRoutingResult | None``
    where ``decide`` returns a bare ``RoutingDecisionResult``, so the return
    annotation is compared as a *set of type names* rather than as a single
    ``ast.Name``: ``X | None`` walks to ``{"X"}`` because ``None`` is a
    constant, and ``-> tuple[Agent, ...]`` walks to something bigger and
    fails. The extra classes on the other side of the boundary
    (``ResolvedChannelPolicy``, today only the routing module's) are named on
    the record too, so a module that takes no such value simply lists none.
